• find the perimeter of a sector of a circle and • solve problems related to the perimeter of plane figures containing sectors In previous grades you have learnt how to find the perimeter of plane figures such as a rectangle, a square, a triangle and a circle. Facts relating to these can be summarized as follows.       While doing the above exercise you would have recalled facts on finding the perimeter of some basic plane figures as well as of compound figures. Now let us consider the perimeter of sectors of circles. The region which is shaded in this figure is a portion of a circle with centre C which is bounded by two radii and a part of the circumference. Such a portion is called a  which is the angle sector of a circle. The angle θ between the two radii is called the angle at the centre. 1. Find the perimeter of each of the following plane figures. (i)            The figure illustrates a sector of a circle of radius r. Such a sector is called a sector of radius r and angle at the centre θ. Let us now consider how the arc length of such a sector of a circle is found. Let us first find the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r. We know that the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2πr. he angle at the centre of the circle is 360o. The arc length corresponding to this angle is the circumference of the circle which is 2πr. Here, the reason for taking the arc length of the semi-circle to be πr, that is, the value of 2πr divided by 2, is the symmetry of the circle. The expression πr for the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r can be obtained by reasoning out in the following manner too. Let us consider a circle and a semi-circle, both of radius r. 360o. Therefore, the arc length of the semi-circle should be of the arc length of the circle.        In the same manner, since the angle at the centre is 90o for a sector which is the circle, Reasoning out in this manner, an expression can easily be obtained for the arc length of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θ x. The circumference of the circle = 2πr Arc length =         Study the following table to understand further about finding the arc length of a sector of a circle. the fraction of arc Length as a the circumference (According to the figure) Angle at the centre Angle at the centre as a fraction of the total angle at the centre Observe the 1st and 2nd columns of the table. If the length of the arc of the circle can be identified from the figure as a fraction of the circumference, then the length of the arc can easily be found. When the angle at the centre is in degrees, this fraction is  angle at the centre 360                  Accordingly, it should be clearer to you now that the length of an arc with angle at the centre θx and radius r is Now let us consider several examples. In the following examples and exercises it is assumed that the value of π is 22 7 (i) What fraction of the circumference of the circle in the figure is the arc length of the shaded sector? Let the radius be r cm.  Arc length                 Example 3 The arc length of the sector in the figure is 11 cm. Find the angle at the centre of this sector. Let θ o be the angle at the centre.  Then,  arc length cm 9  2 1              To obtain the perimeter of a sector of a circle, the arc length and the lengths of the two radii by which the sector is bounded should be added together. The figure denotes a sector of a circle of radius 21 cm with angle at the centre 120o. Find its perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θ  The perimeter of the sector = 44 + 2 « 21  = 86 cm Example 2 The perimeter of a sector which is  2 1                      2 1 c 60x  (i) when the angle at the centre is 180x and the perimeter is 180 cm. (ii) when the angle at the centre is 120x and the perimeter is 43 cm.  (i) when the perimeter is 64 cm and radius is 21 cm. (ii) when the perimeter is 53 cm and the radius is 21 cm.                    Let us see how the perimeter of plane figures containing sectors of circles is found by considering several examples.  The figure illustrates how a semi-circle has been joined to a rectangle of length 20 cm and breadth 14 cm such that the breadth of the rectangle is the diameter of the semi-circle. Find the perimeter of this figure. The figure represents a square lamina of side length 15 cm. If the shaded sector (AGB) and the triangular portion (GEF) are cut out, find the perimeter of the portion (BCDFG) that is left over. Perimeter of BCDFG is BC + CD + DF + FG + arc length GB First let us find the length of FG. Let us apply PythagorasZ theorem to the right angled triangle GEF.                      Next let us find the arc length GB. Since the angle at the centre of the sector ABG is 90o,  BC = 15 − 7 cm  = 8 cm  DF = 15 − 6 cm  = 9 cm    = 8 + 15 + 9 + 10 + 11  = 53 cm 7 cm O 2. A semi-circular portion of diameter 7 cm has been cut out from a semi-circular lamina of radius 7 cm and welded to the lamina again as shown in the figure.  (ii) Find the arc length of the sector of the circle of diameter 7 cm (iii) Find the perimeter of the shaded region.  cm 4                                  3. The figure illustrates how an equilateral triangle of side length 7 cm is drawn within a sector of a circle of radius the length of a side of the triangle. (i) Find the arc length of the sector of the circle. (ii) Find the perimeter of the shaded region.   4. The figure shows two sectors of circles ABED and CDFB. If AB = 10.5 cm, find the perimeter of the shaded region using the given data. 5. The figure shows two sectors of circles of centre A and radius AD and AR respectively. How much greater is the perimeter of the sector APQR than the perimeter of the shaded region? 45x 3'5 cm      1. A sector of a circle as shown in the figure, with angle at the centre equal to 120o has been cut out from a circular lamina of radius 21 cm. Show that the perimeter of the remaining portion of the lamina is 130 cm.                    2. The figure depicts a pond having semi-circular boundaries. A protective fence along the boundary of the pond has been planned.  (ii) It has been estimated that the cost of constructing 1 m of the fence is Rs. 5000. How much will it cost to complete the whole fence? 4. A portion of a grill to be fixed to a window has been made by combining two equal sectors of circles as shown in the figure. The person making the grill states that based on the given data, a wire of length 128 cm is required for it. Show with reasons that his statement is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You have earlier learnt some facts about the square of a number, and the square root of a positive number. Let us briefly recall what you have learnt. The value of 3 « 3 is 9. We denote 3 « 3 in short by 32. This is read as ‘three squared’. The ‘2’ in 32 denotes the fact that two threes are multiplied ‘twice’ over. Accordingly, three squared is 9 and this can be written as 32 = 9. 1 2 3 4 5  1 × 1  2 × 2  3 × 3  4 × 4  5 × 5 How the square of the number is denoted  12 22 32 42 52 Square of the number 1 4 9 16 25 Numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares. Finding the square root is the inverse of squaring. For example, since 32 = 9, we say that the square root of 9 is 3. It will be clear to you, according to the first and last columns of the above table that  the square root of 1 is 1,  the square root of 4 is 2,  the square root of 9 is 3,  the square root of 16 is 4  and the square root of 25 is 5.   By studying this lesson you will be able to • approximate the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect square • use the division method to find an approximate value for the square root of a  It is clear that every number has a square. However, does every positive number have a square root? Let us investigate this. According to the above table, the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 9 is 3. The square root of a number between 4 and 9 is a value between 2 and 3. Accordingly, it is clear that the square root of a number between 4 and 9 is not an integer. It is a decimal number. In this lesson we will consider how an approximate value is found for this. We call such a value an approximation. Let us for example consider how an approximate value is obtained for the square root of 5. Consider the following table. Number How the square of the number is found How the square of the number is written The square of the number 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2 × 2 2.1 × 2.1 2.2 × 2.2 2.3 × 2.3 2.4 × 2.4 2.5 × 2.5 2.6 × 2.6 2.7 × 2.7 22 2.12 2.22 2.32 2.42 2.52 2.62 2.72 4 4.41 4.84 5.29 5.76 6.25 6.76 7.29 From the values in the right hand side column, the two values that are closest to 5 are 4.84 and 5.29. They are the squares of 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. According to the above table, the square roots of 4.84 and 5.29 are respectively 2.2 and 2.3. This can be written symbolically as Now let us examine which value from 4.84 and 5.29 is closer to 5. The difference between 4.84 and 5 = 5 – 4.84 = 0.16 The difference between 5.29 and 5 = 5.29 – 5 = 0.29 Accordingly, the value that is closer to 5 is 4.84. Therefore, 2.2 can be taken as an approximate value for the square root of 5. The value that is obtained for the square root of a positive integer which is correct to the first decimal place is called the “approximation to the first decimal place” of the square root of the given number (or more simply the “first approximation”) Accordingly, the approximation of square root of 5 to the first decimal place is 2.2. When an approximate value is given, the symbol is used. Accordingly, we can write By providing reasons in a similar manner, we can conclude that the approximation of square root of 6 to the first decimal place is 2.4 and the approximation of square root of 7 to the first decimal place is 2.6 That is, By considering the following examples let us now learn a specific method of finding the first approximation of the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect square. Approximate • From the perfect square numbers which are less than 17, the one which is closest to it is 16, and from the perfect square numbers which are greater than 17, the one which is closest to it is 25.  Accordingly, let us write 16 < 17 < 25 	 	
	
Accordingly, the square root of 17 is greater than 4 which is the square root of 16, and less than 5 which is the square root of 25. • To find an approximate value close to 16 or to 25. The difference between 16 and 17 is 1. The difference between 17 and 25 is 8.      Since the value of 4.22 exceeds 17, it is unnecessary to find 4.32 and 4.42. 16.81 is the closer value to 17 from these two. Find the first approximation of Since 152 = 225 and 162 = 256, ince 245 is closer to 256 than to 225,  The first approximation of Let us now determine this value. 15'9 x 15'9 = 252'81 15'8 x 15'8 = 249'64 15'7 x 15'7 = 246'49 15'6 x 15'6 = 243'36 From the above values, 246.49 is closest to 245. Exercise 2.1 Find the first approximation of each of the following numbers.         Let us now consider a method of finding the square root of any positive number. This method is called the division method. Let us study this method by considering several examples. Step 1 Separate 1764 as shown below, by grouping the digits of 1764 in pairs, starting from the units position and proceeding towards the left. 17 64 Find the perfect square number which is closest to the leftmost digit or pair of digits of the separated number, and as indicated below, write its square root above and to the left of the drawn lines. Step 3 Write down the product 4 x 4 of the number above and to the left of the lines, below the number 17 as indicated, and subtract it from 17. Next, write on the left as shown below, the digit 8, which is two times the number above the line, leaving space for another number to be written. (i.e., leave space for Step 4 Now carry down the next two digits 64, as indicated below.       The same digit should be written above the line to the right of 4 and in the space left in the units position on the left. This digit should be selected so that the product of this digit and the number obtained on the left when this digit is written in the units position (in this case 82), is equal to 164, or is the closest number less than 164 that can be obtained in this manner. When finding the square root of a decimal number, separate the digits in pairs on both sides of the decimal point, starting at the decimal point as shown below.  3'61  12'321 143'456 3' 61 12' 32 10 1 43' 45 60      We must find the value to three decimal places and round off to two decimal places. To find to three decimal places we must write three pairs of zeros after the decimal point. 5 2 ' 6 3 1 27 37' 00 00 00 25 2 37 2 04 33 00 31 29  1 71 00  1 04 61  66 39 00  62 77 56  3 61 44 As above let us find the value to three decimal places and round off to two decimal places. For this there must be three pairs of decimal places after the decimal point.        Exercise 2.2 1. Find the square root of each of the following numbers.  Area of the square  Length of a side of the square =  Area of the square = 441 cm2  Length of a side of the square =  
     
 
324 square shaped garden tiles of area 900 cm2 each have been placed in a square shaped courtyard so that the courtyard is completely covered with the tiles. Find the length of a side of the courtyard.                          Exercise 2.3 1. What is the length of a side of a square shaped piece of cardboard of area 3. 196 children participating in a drill display have been placed such that they form an equal number of rows and columns. How many children are there in a row? 5. A rectangular walkway has been made by placing 10 flat square shaped concrete slabs along 200 rows. If the area of the flat surface of a concrete slab is 231.04 cm2, what is the length and the breadth of the walkway? Miscellaneous Exercise 1. Find the value accurate to the second decimal place. 2. The length and breadth of a rectangular shaped plot of land are respectively 25 m and 12 m. Find to the nearest metre, the least distance that a child standing at one corner of the plot should travel to reach the diagonally opposite corner of the plot. 3. If the length of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right angled triangle is 12 cm, find the length of a remaining side. (Give the answer to two decimal places).  The figure depicts a slab of a certain type of chocolate. It has been divided into ten equal sized pieces such that the pieces can easily be broken off. When the whole slab of chocolate is considered as one unit, ● one piece of chocolate that is broken off is considered as of fractions. Now let us consider another example. The above figure depicts how pieces of cheese have been arranged in a container. There are 8 equal pieces. One of the pieces has been removed from the container. This piece is of the amount of cheese in the container. If the total mass of all the pieces of cheese in the container is 160 g, then the piece that was removed which is • identify situations in which fractions are applied • solve problems involving fractions.      For example, in the statement “ of all the students in the class are girls”, the  is applied by taking “the total number of students in the class” as the fraction unit. In the following table, the units relevant to several statements involving fractions The volume of atmosphere The piece of wire of length 5 m The circular shape illustrated in the following figure has been divided into 6 equal parts. We know that the fraction that has been shaded is of the shape.                                                                   is 6 and the numerator is 2. The total number of parts into which the unit has been divided is the denominator, and the number of parts being Such fractions are called proper fractions. Fractions such as numerator equal to 1 are called unit fractions. Further, considering fractions such as and the denominators are not, as the denominator increases, the value represented by the fraction decreases. That is, According to the figure, the quantities represented by the three fractions are equal. That is, Such fractions which are equal to each other are called equivalent fractions. Observe that fractions which are equivalent to a given fraction are obtained when     both the numerator and the denominator are multiplied by the same number. For example, Equivalent fractions are also obtained when the numerator and the denominator of the given fraction are divided by the same number. For example, It can be observed that among the fractions which are equivalent to there are some which have the same denominator.  are two more such fractions. For convenience, let us select denominator. Let us explain the comparison of using figures.    Accordingly, it is clear that it is suitable to write equivalent fractions having a common denominator when comparing fractions. Now let us consider the addition and subtraction of fractions. You have learnt in earlier grades to add fractions with equal denominators, as for example Similarly, you know that fractions with equal denominators can be subtracted as for example, When adding and subtracting fractions of unequal denominators, the relevant fractions can first be converted into equivalent fractions of equal denominators. For example, that is obtained when a loaf of bread is divided into two equal parts and three such parts are considered. This quantity is one and a half loaves of bread. That is, loaves of bread, which in short, is a quantity of                  You have learnt in previous grades how a mixed number is converted into an improper fraction and how an improper fraction is converted into a mixed number. It is clear that ‘of’ in and that the numerator can be taken as 1 « 3 and the denominator as 2 « 4'             Let us find how many the following figure that this value is 2. However, since half of any quantity, is the amount that is obtained when the quantity is divided by 2, t is not convenient to draw figures every time we divide fractions. We need to identify a different method to do this. The above division of fractions which was done using figures, can also be presented in the following manner.            Do the following exercise to further recall the facts that have been learnt about fractions. That is, the same answer that was obtained with the figures is obtained using this method too. The order in which the mathematical operations are manipulated when simplifying fractions, is as follows: In general, when a fraction needs to be divided by another fraction, the first fraction can be multiplied by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Let us recall all the facts that have been learnt so far regarding fractions by working out the following example. B – Brackets O – Of D – Division M – Multiplication A – Addition S – Subtraction          Unit Fractions Proper Fractions Improper Fractions Mixed number Improper fraction  of a tank which was completely filled with water was used by a household for its needs on a certain day, what fraction of the tank still held water by the end       7. If the two shaded regions of the circular lamina that has been divided into eight equal parts as shown in the figure, are cut out and discarded,  (i) what fraction of the total lamina is remaining?  (ii) what fraction of the total lamina is exactly half the remaining                                                         Fractions are used in many calculations that come up in day to day life. These calculations can easily be carried out with a correct understanding of fractions. Given below are several examples of such situations. Example 1  of a mixture of flour prepared to make a certain type of food consists of kurakkan flour, while the remaining portion consists of wheat flour. A cook wishes to prepare  Quantity of kurakkan flour in the mixture = 20 kg  The quantity of wheat flour in the mixture = 50 – 20 kg Example 2 It takes 12 minutes to fill  of a certain tank using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate.

Do the following exercise to recall the facts you have learnt earlier about simplifying algebraic expressions. What you simplified in 3(b) above is the product of two binomial expressions of the form x + a.

(All the measurements below are assumed to have been given in the same units). A  length of AB = 3x + 2  length of AD = 2x + 3 According to the figure, Area of the rectangle ABCD = The sum of the areas of the four smaller rectangles = 6x2 + 9x + 4x + 6 = 6x2 + 13x + 6 It is clear according to (1) and (2) that, (3x + 2) (2x + 3) = 6x2 + 13x + 6 Now study how the binomial expressions of different types given in the following examples have been expanded and simplified.  (2x + y) (x + 3y) = 2x (x + 3y) + y (x + 3y) = 2x2 + 6xy + xy + 3y2 = 2x2 + 7xy + 3y2                             a. (x + 2) (x + 2) b. (x – 3) (x – 3)  d. (2p – 5) (p – 3) e. (3x – 1) (3x + 1)  g.

A child bought a mandarins which were priced at x rupees each. He then decides to buy three times that number of apples. The price of an apple is twice the price of a mandarin. (i) Write an expression in terms of a and x for the cost of the apples.  The fruit seller states that if the number of apples that are bought is increased by 5 fruits, he can reduce the price of each apple that is bought by 3 rupees. Accordingly, the child decides to buy 5 more apples. 3. Piyumi made a square - shaped flower bed. Her sister made a rectangular flower  bed. The length of the sister's bed was 3 metres more than of Piyumi's and the  width was 2 metres less than of Piyumi's. Taking the length of one side of  Piyumi's bed as x, write the length and width of the sister's bed in terms of x and  then express its area in the form Ax2 + Bx + C.      Let us turn our attention again to the following expressions which you expanded in the above exercise. Do you notice that the two binomial expressions to be multiplied are equal? (x – 3) (x – 3) = (x – 3)2 (5x – 2y) (5x – 2y) = (5x – 2y)2 Each of these expressions written in the form (x + 2)2, (x – 3)2 and (5x – 2y)2 is called the square of the respective binomial expression. The same method that was used above to simplify the product of two binomial expressions can be used to expand such squares of binomial expressions too. Simplifying the square of a binomial expression can be done using another method too. Now let us consider how the squares of binomial expressions of the form (a + b) and (a – b) are expanded. (iii) Write down the price of an apple in terms of x. (iv) Write down the cost of the apples in terms of a and x. (v) Expand and simplify the binomial expression in (iv) above.               Two times the product of the first and second terms Now let us consider the expansion of (a − b)2  Note : The expansion of (a − b)2 can also be obtained by substituting − b for b in the expansion of (a + b)2 i.e., (a + (− b))2 = a2 + 2(a) (− b) + (− b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2 Also, You may have observed that the expansions of (a + b)2 and (–a – b)2 are equal to each other and that the expansions of (a – b)2 and (–a + b)2 too are equal to each other.

Such figures are called rectilinear plane figures. The sides and the angles are called the elements (parts) of these figures. The pairs of rectilinear plane figures presented below in figures (i) to (iv), which are identical in shape and size can be placed on each other such that they coincide. A pair of plane figures which may be made to coincide is called a pair of congruent plane figures. In this section we concentrate on the congruence of pairs of triangles. A triangle has six elements. They are the three sides and the three angles of the triangle. Let us assume that the two triangles ABC and PQR given below are congruent. Let us also assume that, when the two triangles are placed one on top of the other By studying this lesson you will be able to  • recognize the congruence of two plane figures  • identify the necessary conditions for two triangles to be congruent  • prove riders by using the congruence of triangles such that they coincide, then AB coincides with PQ, AC coincides with PR and BC coincides with QR. Then we say that, in the two triangles, the side corresponding to AB is PQ, the side corresponding to AC is PR and the side corresponding to BC , the angle is QR. Similarly, we say that the angle corresponding to . corresponding to  and the angle corresponding to A Q ZZ' For We indicate the fact that two triangles are congruent by using the symbol zz example, if the two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent, we indicate this fact by writing  It is not necessary to show that the six elements of one triangle are equal to the six elements of the other triangle as indicated above to show that a pair of triangles is congruent. It is sufficient to show that three of the elements are equal. However, this does not mean that if any three elements of one triangle are equal to three elements of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. In certain cases, when three elements of one triangle are equal to three elements of another triangle, then the remaining elements too are equal and the triangles are congruent. There are four such cases. Let us now consider these four cases. The case in which two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle Three triangles with two sides of length 2'5 cm and 3'5 cm and an angle of magnitude 30o are given below. A 2 ' 5  cm 2 ' 5  2 ' 5     This result which you discovered through the above activity has been used as an axiom of geometry from ancient times. If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent in the above manner is mentioned in short as being congruent under the case SAS. It must be clear to you through the above activity, that only the triangle PQR is congruent to the triangle ABC. Both the triangles PQR and LMN have three elements which are equal to the given three elements of the triangle ABC. However, the triangle ABC is only congruent to the triangle PQR. It should be clear to you from this that, just because two triangles have three elements which are equal to each other, it does not mean that the triangles are congruent. Let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR but not to the triangle LMN. The 30o angle of the triangle ABC is the included angle of the sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm. It is the same for the triangle PQR. However the 30o angle is not the included angle of the sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm of the triangle LMN. Two sides and the included angle of triangle ABC are equal to two sides and the included angle of triangle PQR. But this cannot be said about the triangles ABC and LMN. There is insufficient data to state that and ABC and  Note: Here the angle ACB AC and CB. Similarly, the angle RPQ of the triangle PQR.                   That is, the sides AB and QR which are opposite the equal angles ACB to each other, the angles ABC PQ are equal to each other, and the angles CAB equal to each other. Now let us consider an example. According to the data marked on the figure, prove that the triangles ABC and ADC are congruent, and write all the remaining equal corresponding elements.  1. Determine for which pairs of triangles the SAS case can be applied to prove congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.                   2. For each of the following parts, draw a sketch of the relevant pairs of triangles based on the information that is given. From these pairs of triangles, select the ones which are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.  (i) In the triangles PQR and XYZ, (ii) In the triangles ABC and LMN, (iii) In the triangles DEF and STU, (iv) In the triangles ABC and PQR, Prove that,  (i)  (ii) AC = BD. In the quadrilateral ABCD, the sides AD and BC are parallel and equal in length. Mark the given data in the diagram and prove that, (i) (ii) AB = DC, (iii) AB and DC are parallel to each other.                            (i) (ii) the lines AD and BC are parallel to each other.  Now let us consider the second case by which the congruence of two triangles can be identified. (b) Second Case The case in which the magnitudes of two angles and the length of a side of a triangle are equal to the magnitudes of two angles and the length of a corresponding side of another triangle ² Copy the triangle ABC onto a tissue paper and cut it out. ² Place it on the triangles PQR and LMN and examine which triangle it coincides It must be clear to you according to this activity that the trianlge ABC is congruent only to the triangle PQR. In this case too, as in the case (a), the two triangles PQR and LMN have three elements which are equal to three elements of the triangle ABC. However, although the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR, it is not congruent to the triangle LMN. As before, it should be clear to you from this that, just because two triangles have three elements which are equal to each other, it does not mean that the triangles are congruent. Consider the triangles given below. P Using the information marked on the triangle ABC, prove that,  (i) (ii)       Therefore, let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR. The given side of length 2.5 cm is opposite the given 30o angle of the triangle ABC. It is the same for the triangle PQR. However it is not the same in the triangle LMN. Accordingly, two angles of triangle ABC is equal to two angles of triangle PQR, and one side of triangle ABC is equal to the corresponding side of triangle PQR. However, the corresponding side of triangle LMN is not equal to that of triangle ABC. Note: Here, corresponding sides are defined as those which are opposite equal angles of the two triangles. Using the given data, we can show as done below, that the triangles STU and LMN in the following figure are congruent according to the case mentioned above. (Given) (Given) Note: In the above two triangles ST and MN are a pair of corresponding sides which are also equal. Observe carefully that they are corresponding sides because they are opposite the angles SUT Example 1 Based on the data marked on the figure, prove that, remaining equal corresponding elements.   (Given) (Given) is a common side (AAS) If two angles and a side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely as being congruent according to the AAS case.                    Two angles of the triangle ABC are equal to two angles of the triangle PQR. Also, AB = PQ. However, they are not corresponding sides. The reason for this is that the angles ACB  which are opposite these two sides are not equal to each other. ^ & Therefore, there are insufficient 6 5 reasons to say that the two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent to each other by the case AAS. Mention for which pairs of triangles the AAS conditions can be applied to prove congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the other pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.                = C 2. For each of the following parts, draw a sketch of the relevant pair of triangles based on the information that is given. From these pairs of triangles, select the ones that are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other. i. In the triangles ABC and PQR, ii. In the triangles XYZ and LMN, iii. In the triangles STU and PQR, iv. In the triangles DEF and ABC, In the given figure, AB and CD are parallel to each other and BO = OD. Show that The pairs of sides AB and FE, and AC and DE are parallel to each other. Show that  > > > >        Let us consider the third case by which the congruence of two triangles can be identified. (c) Third Case Can a unique triangle be constructed when the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are given? To determine this, engage in the following activity. This result which you established through the above activity can also be used as an axiom. We can show in the following manner that the pair of triangles XYZ and DEF are congruent according to the above case. (Given) (Given) Break off pairs of ekel sticks of lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm respectively. Make two triangles of side lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm with these pieces. Do you see that the two triangles have to be congruent? By changing the positions of the pieces of ekel in one triangle, can you create a triangle which is not congruent to the other triangle? It must be clear to you that this is not possible.  If the three sides of a triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely as being congruent according to the SSS case.     Example 1 Prove that  based on the information in the figure and write all the remaining equal corresponding elements. (Given) (Given) 1. Determine for which of the following pairs of the triangles the SSS conditions can be used to show congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other. X  (iii) = Q                          The case of the hypotenuse and a side of a right - angled triangle being equal to the hypotenuse and a side of another right - angled triangle. A pair of right-angled triangles drawn such that the hypotenuse is 3 cm and another side is 2.5 cm is shown below. 2. Draw a sketch of the following triangles based on the information that is given. Select the triangles (if there are any) which are congruent according to the SSS case and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.  In triangle PQR, PQ = 4 cm, QR = 6 cm, RP = 5 cm  In triangle XYZ, XY = 6 cm, YZ = 8 cm, ZX = 10 cm  In triangle LMN, LM = 5 cm, NM = 4 cm, NL = 6 cm  In triangle DEF, DE = 8 cm, EF = 10 cm, FD = 6 cm  In triangle ABC, BC = 8 cm, CA = 7 cm, AB = 9 cm  In triangle STU, ST = 9 cm, TU = 7 cm, SU = 5 cm To bisect the angle ABC , a student selects the point B as the centre and draws the arc PQ. The arc intersects AB and BC at the points P and Q respectively. Two equal arcs drawn from the points P and Q intersect at R. Prove that The opposite sides of the quadrilateral PQRS are equal in length. Prove that,  (i)  (ii) (iii) the opposite sides of the quadrilateral are parallel.  
 
        Accordingly, the congruence of a pair of right-angled triangles can be expressed in terms of the equality of two elements as follows. If the lengths of the hypotenuse and a side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the lengths of the hypotenuse and a side of another right-angled triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely as being congruent according to the RHS (right-angle-hypotenuse-side) case. Let us prove that the two triangles given below are congruent based on the information that is given. Since the above pair of triangles is congruent, the remaining pairs of corresponding elements are also equal. That is, Based on the information in the figure, prove that,  and write all the remaining equal  
corresponding elements. Proof:  In the right-angled triangles OXA and OXB, Copy the triangle in figure (i) onto a tissue paper and examine whether it can be made to coincide with the triangle in figure (ii).                    1. Determine for which of the following pairs of the triangles the RHS conditions can be used to show congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.

Now let us consider how the area of a sector of a circle is found. The following table shows how the area of a sector is found when the angle at the centre of the sector takes certain special values.

                 Let us consider (through the following examples) how the area of a sector is found using this result. In the examples and exercises of this chapter, the value of π is taken as 22 7 If the area of the sector in the figure is circle. 1 9 According to the pattern in the table, the area of the sector of radius r and angle at the centre θx is θ 360 r x          Let us consider the areas of plane figures formed by sectors of circles and other simple plane figures such as rectangles and triangles being joined together. The following denotes a plane figure consisting of a square and a semi-circle. Find its area.      Area of the square = 14 x 14  = 196 cm2     Since the diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of a side of the square, The radius of the circle is 14 ÷ 2 = 7 cm.

A sketch of the area in front of a commemorative plaque is given in the figure. Grass has been grown in the three portions within the semi-circle which are in the shape of sectors of circles, while white sand has been spread in the other regions.  The radius of each sector within the semi-circle 60x a                                                                                                                  We know that 2x + 6 is a binomial algebraic expression. Since it can be expressed as 2(x + 3), we also know that 2 and x + 3 are its factors. Similarly, since 4x2 + 6x = 2x (2x + 3), we know that 2, x and 2x + 3 are the factors of 4x2 + 6x. Now let us find the factors of a2 – 2a + ab – 2b B. a. c. e. g. i. l. h. k. b. d. f. h.   • find the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions,  • find the factors of the difference of two squares.      2. Fill in the blanks in (i) and (ii), and factor the expressions given below them accordingly. Now let us consider factoring quadratic expressions such as x2 + 2x – 3. This expression is of the form ax2 + bx + c. Here a, b and c take integer values. We call an algebraic expression of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are non-zero, a trinomial quadratic expression in x. a is said to be the coefficient of x2, b the coefficient of x and c the constant term. It is easy to find the factors of such an expression when the terms are written in this order. The coefficient of x2 in x2 + 2x – 3 is 1 while the coefficient of x is 2 and the constant term is – 3. 4 + 2x – x2 is also a trinomial quadratic expression. To find its factors it can be written in the order – x2 + 2x + 4. When the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 2xy – y2 is considered, it can be thought of as a quadratic expression in x or a quadratic expression in y. When it is considered as a quadratic expression in y, it is convenient to write it in the form – y2 + 2xy + x2. or example, while 3x2 − 2x − 5, a2 + 2a + 8, y2 + 2y − 5 and 5 −2x − 3x2 are trinomial quadratic expressions, the expressions a + 2x + 3 and 2x3 + 3x2 −5x are not. Let us recall how the product of two binomial expressions such as x + 2 and x + 3 is found. Since x2 + 5x + 6 is obtained as the product of x + 2 and x + 3, we obtain that x + 2 and x + 3 are factors of x2 + 5x + 6. x2 + 5x + 6 is a trinomial qudratic  (i) a (2x −y) + b (y − 2x)  = a (2x −y) − b (........)  = (........)

Let us consider the following table to do this. The two terms in the first column have been selected such that their product is 10x2.  Pair of terms  x, 10x  2x, 5x  (−x), (− 10x) (−2x) , (− 5x) Product  x x 10x = 10x2  2x x 5x = 10x2  (−x) x(− 10x) = 10x2 (−2x) x(− 5x) = 10x2 Sum  x +10x = 11 x  2x + 5x = 7 x  (−x )+ (−10x) = −11x (−2x) + (−5x ) = −7x It is clear from the above table that the middle term 7x should be written as 2x + 5x. Now, let us find the factors of the given trinomial quadratic expression. Let us see whether the factors are different if we write the middle term of x2 + 7x + 10 as the sum 5x + 2x, instead of 2x + 5x. x2 + 7x + 10 = x2 + 5x + 2x + 10 = x (x+ 5) + 2(x+ 5) = (x+ 5) (x+ 2)           expression. How do we obtain x + 2 and x + 3 as its factors? Let us examine the steps that were performed to obtain the product of the above two expressions, in the reverse order. been expressed as a sum of two terms, as 3x + 2x ² The product of the terms 3x and 2x = 3x « 2x = 6x2 ² The product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial quadratic We can come to the following conclusions based on the above observations. The middle term should be written as the sum of two terms. The product of these two terms should be equal to the product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial expression. As an example, let us factor x2 + 7x + 10 accordingly. Here, 7x is the middle term. This should be written as the sum of two terms. Also, the product of these two terms should be equal to 10x2.         We observe that the same factors are obtained. Therefore, the order in which we write the two terms that were selected has no effect on the factors. Accordingly, the factors can be found by writing 7x as either 2x + 5x or as 5x + 2x. Find the two terms which have 12a2 as their product and −8a as their sum. The following table contains pairs of terms of which the product is 12a2. The pair which when added equals – 8a has been shaded.  a + 12a = 13a  2a + 6a = 8a  3a + 4a = 7a  (−a) + (−12a) = −13a  (−2a ) + (−6a) = −8a  (−3a) + (−4a) = −7a 12a 12a 12a 12a 12a 12a Product = = = = = = ) ) ) ) That is, − 8a can be written as −2a − 6a a2 −8a + 12 = a2 −2a − 6a +12   - - - Note(- obtained as a sum mentally too. Factor x2 − 7x − 8. The product of the initial and final terms = x2 × (−8) = − 8x2 The two terms which have −8x2 as their product and −7x as their sum are + x and − 8x. Accordingly,  Now let us consider how an expression such as − x2 − x + 6 which has a negative quadratic term is factored. The factors can be found by re-writing the expression The product of the initial and final terms = a2 «12 = 12a2  The middle term = − 8a           as 6 − x − x2, with the quadratic term at the end. By considering the example given below, let us recognize the fact that the factors can be found using either form. Factor − x2 − x + 6. The product of the initial and final terms = − 6x2 The middle term = − x ' '' Example 4 Factor a2 − 4ab − 5b2. We may consider this as a trinomial quadratic expression in a. Then, the product of the initial and final terms = a2 « (−5b2) = −5a2b2 The two terms which have −5a2b2 as their product and −4ab as their sum are ab and −5ab. Note( This can also be considered as a trinomial quadratic expression in b and factored. Then too the above answer is obtained. The errors made in simplification can be minimized by examing the accuracy of the factors of a trinomial quadratic expression once they have been found. For example, let us factor x2 + 3x – 40.  x2 + 3x – 40 = x2 + 8x – 5x – 40 = x (x + 8) – 5 (x + 8) x + 8) (x – 5)             If the factors x + 8 and x – 5 are correct, by multiplying them together we should be able to get back our original expression. Let us find the product of x + 8 and x – 5 (x + 8) (x – 5) = x2 – 5x + 8x – 40  = x2 + 3x – 40  Since we have obtained our original expression x2 + 3x – 40, the factors x + 8 and x – 5 are correct.

So far we have considered only how the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions with the coefficient of x2 equal to either 1 or –1 are found. Now let us consider how the factors are found when the coefficient of x2 is some other integer. For example, let us consider the trinomial quadratic expression 3x2 + 14x + 15. This is of the form ax2 + bx + c with a = 3. In such cases too we can use the same method that we used above. Example 1 Factor 3x2 + 14x + 15.

We observe from the above expansion that the factors of x2 − y2 are x − y and x + y. Further, x2 − y2 can be considered as a quadratic expression in x and factored. By taking its middle term to be 0, we can write it in the form of a trinomial quadratic expression as x2 + 0 − y2. Let us factor this expression. Product of the initial and final terms = − x2y2  Middle term = 0 Therefore, by this too we obtain x2 – y2 = (x – y) (x + y). Let us consider the following examples of the factorization of expressions which are the difference of two squares. 7.3 The factors of expressions which are in the form of the  difference of two squares               a. e. i. b. f. j. c. g. d. h. 3.

Since BCD is a straight is an adjacent supplementary angle of line, which are the interior angles of triangle ABC apart from are called the interior opposite angles of the exterior angle . In the same manner, there are pairs of interior opposite angles corresponding to the exterior angles formed by producing the other two sides of the triangle too.  The following theorem specifies a relationship that exists between an exterior angle of a triangle and its interior opposite angles.

If two sides of a triangle are equal, then it is called an isosceles triangle. The triangle ABC in the figure given below is an isosceles triangle. In this triangle, AB = AC. The angle in front of each side of a triangle is called the angle opposite that side. The angle opposite the side AB is The angle opposite the side AC is The angle opposite the side BC is Further, A, which is the vertex at which the two equal sides meet is called the apex of the triangle. . . . According to the theorem, since AB = AC in the above isosceles triangle ABC, ' Let us engage in the following activity to verify the truth of the above Now let us consider several problems that can be solved by applying the above theorem together with theorems that have been learnt previously. ² Mark three points A, B and C (not collinear) such that AB = AC = 5cm. ² Complete the triangle ABC by joining the points A, B and C. ² Cut out the shape of the triangle ABC. ² Fold the triangular shaped piece of paper so that AB and AC coincide. ² Observe that  are equal.

In some instances, a result in geometry can be proved in several ways. Now, let us consider such a result. AB = AC in the triangle ABC. The side BA has been produced to E. The angle is bisected by AD. Prove that AD and BC are parallel to each other.  1. the perpendicular drawn from the apex to the opposite side  2. the bisector of the apex angle,  3. the straight line joining the apex to the midpoint of the opposite side and 4. the perpendicular bisector of the side opposite the apex,  coincide with each other.      To prove that AD // BC, let us show that either a pair of alternate angles or a pair of corresponding angles are equal to each other. Proof: Method 1 In the triangle ABC, Since the side BA of the triangle ABC has been produced to E, This is a pair of alternate angles. Since a pair of alternate angles are equal, AD is parallel to BC. Method 2 and EAD According to the above figure, are a pair of corresponding angles. By showing that these two angles are equal in the same manner as above, we can show that BC // AD. Method 3 The above proof could also be given as follows using algebraic symbols.

The gravitational force on earth is six times the gravitational force on the moon. Therefore, the ratio of the weight of an object on the moon to the weight of the object on earth is 1 : 6.

If it is necessary to make a cement mixture using the whole bag, how many pans of sand are required? (iv) Find separately the number of pans of cement and the number of pans of sand  We know that, when we consider two quantities, if when one quantity increases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity also increases in the same ratio, or when one quantity decreases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity also decreases in the same ratio, then the two quantities are said to be directly proportional to each other. In an inverse proportion, when one quantity increases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity decreases in the same ratio, or when one quantity decreases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity increases in the same ratio. In a certain hostel, there is sufficient food stored for 12 hostellers for 4 days. Keeping this amount of food in mind, let us consider the following questions.  (i) If the number of hostellers is 15, will the food be sufficient for four days?  (ii) If the number of hostellers is 6, for how many days will the food be sufficient?  (iii) When the number of hostellers decreases, does the number of days for which It is clear that the food which is sufficient for 12 people for 4 days will be sufficient for 6 people for 8 days, and for one person for 48 days. The following relationships between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient can easily be identified. 12 8 6 4  2 1    
   
 
 
4 6 8 12 24 Let us see how the two quantities, namely the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient change proportionally. According to the above chart, when the number of hostellers decreases from 8 to 2, the number of days for which the food is sufficient increases from 6 to 24.                            In this case, the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1 The number of days for which the food is sufficient in this case has increased from 6 to 24.  The ratio of the number of days = 6 : 24 = 1 : 4 Although the ratio 1 : 4 is not equal to the ratio 4 : 1, the ratio that is obtained by interchanging the two numbers of one ratio is the same as the other ratio. Then,  the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1 the ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 24 : 6 = 4 : 1 A relationship such as the above one between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient is called an inverse proportion. Let us consider two more instances of the relationship between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient. 12  1 Number of days  4  48    Ratio of the number of hostellers = 12 : 1  Ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 48 : 4 = 12 : 1 The inverse proportion relationship should hold for any two cases that are considered, in the same manner that was observed in the above cases. It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. Find the number of days required by 10 men to complete the same task. Let us look at two methods that can be used to solve this problem. Note that this is a problem on inverse proportions.             Method 1 Let us take the number of days required by 10 men to complete the task as x. Then,  Number of men  5 10    Number of days  8  x    5 : 10 = x : 8  =      
 Time taken for 5 men to complete the task = 8 days Time taken for one man to complete the task = 8 days « 5 Note: In the above example, the number of days taken by one man to complete the task, which is 40, can be taken as a measurement of the magnitude of the task. This value is called the number of man days.  Magnitude of the task = Amount of time required by one man to complete the task  = Number of men « Number of days Accordingly, the magnitude of the above task can be considered as 40 man days. The magnitude of a task can be measured in terms of man days as well as in terms of man hours.    It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. How many men are required to complete the same task in 2 days? Let us use method (ii) of example 1.  The number of days required by 5 men to complete the task = 8  The number of days required by one man to complete the task = 8 « 5  The magnitude of the task = 8 « 5 man days  = 40 man days

If 8 more men join the workforce after 6 days, for how many more days will the food that is remaining be sufficient? Let us now consider how this problem is solved by two different methods. The food which is sufficient for the group of 40 men for 12 days will be sufficient for the 40 of them for 6 days and for a few more days for the 48 men, which includes the 8 who joined later. Let us take the number of days for which the food will be sufficient for the 48 men after the 6th day as x. We can then equate the amount of food sufficient for the 40 men for 12 days to the sum of the amount of food sufficient for the 40 men for 6 days and the 48 men for x days.  40 « 12  480  48x = (40 « 6) + (48 « x) = 240 + 48x = 480 − 240 = 240                                                (ii) The radius of a circle and its area (…….)

However, two days after the camp commenced, 6 of the trainees had to leave the camp due to illness. Show that the remaining food is sufficient for 2 extra days than was initially planned. 6. A particular tank of water can be emptied in four hours using three equal pumps. The three pumps were used to empty the tank. However one pump stopped working after an hour. Thereafter, the tank was emptied using the other two pumps. Find how much more time was required to empty the tank due to breakdown of one pump. If it takes eight men one day to complete a certain task, then • four men would require two days to complete the same task • if only two men are engaged, four days would be required to complete the task • it would take one man eight days to complete the task Observe that in all four of the above situations, the product of the number of men and the number of days is a constant. That is, This constant value is the magnitude of the task. The unit used to measure the magnitude of the task can be taken as man days. Accordingly, if x is the number of men and y is the number of days, then  xy = k (k is a constant)  x = k According to the definition of direct proportion, this can be expressed as ' That is, x and are directly proportional to each other. In this case we say that x and y are inversely proportional to each other. 8 men can complete a certain task in 9 days. However, it was possible to employ only 6 men. How many days will it take these 6 men to complete the task? Let us denote the number of men by x and the number of days by y. Then, by using the equation xy = k and substituting the data, we obtain the equations, 7. It takes half an hour for a certain vehicle travelling at a speed of 40 kmh-1 to complete a certain journey. Find the time in minutes that it would take the vehicle to complete the same journey, if it travels at a speed of 50 kmh-1.  (Hint: Man hours = no.of men « no.of days « no.of working hours per day)  (i) What is the magnitude of the task in man hours?  (ii) The four men decide to complete the task on the next day. How many hours       8 « 9 k and  6y Note that we can use the same constant k as we refer to the same task. Since it is the same task, the constant k is the same. Substituting for k, we obtain the equation A group of men, who completed a certain task in 9 days, recruited 3 more men to work on a similar task. If together they completed the task in 6 days, find how many men there were in the initial group. Suppose the number of men who were in the first group is x. Then, according to the data, we obtain the equations, 2. It was necessary to engage 9 men for 4 days, at 5 hours per day to clear a certain land. How many men working 6 hours per day can complete the same task in 10 days?    The information gathered from the grade 10 students of a certain school regarding the sport they like the most, of the three sports, namely cricket, volleyball and elle is given below. Cricket Volleyball Elle 25 20 15 The above information can be represented in a picture graph and a column graph as follows. The height of each column in the column graph denotes the number of students who like the relevant sport. In the picture graph this is denoted by the figures. The pie chart is another method of representing data. Pie charts are also called pie graphs. ² draw pie charts based on the given data ² extract information from a pie chart         Let us represent the 60 students by the total area of the circle, which corresponds to the angle of 360o around the centre of the circle. 1  That is, the angle at the centre of a sector which is In a pie chart, the area of the whole circle represents the total number of data. The different frequencies are represented by suitable sectors. As an example, let us consider the above circle which has been divided into 8 equal sectors. Since the circle has been divided into 8 equal sectors, the area of each sector is equal to Also, the angle around the centre of this circle is divided into eight equal parts by the sectors. 1 Therefore, the angle at the centre of each sector is  of the angle around the centre. The angle around the center is 360x. Therefore the angle at the centre of each sector is 1 of 360x.  Accordingly, the angle at the centre of the sector which denotes the 25 students who like cricket the most The sector which denotes the students who like cricket the most Similarly, the angle at the centre of the sector which denotes the 20 students who like volleyball the most The remaining sector of the circle represents the students who like elle. The ' However this is not corresponding angle at the centre can be found using necessary, since this angle is equal to the angle obtained by subtracting the above two angles from 360o' All the above facts can be shown in a pie chart as follows. Usually the angle at the centre is not denoted in a pie chart. Instead, the value represented by each sector is given as a percentage. Cricket 150x    It is not neccessary to calculate the angle at the centre of the sector denoting those who prefer vegetables since the remaining portion of the circle denotes this. The pie chart prepared according to the above information is given below. The comparison of data is facilitated by the sectors being shaded in different colours or covered with different patterns' Since all the data is represented by one circle comparisons such as ‘more than’ or ‘less than’ can easily be made.

The government of each country collects money from its citizens to meet recurrent expenses. This money is called taxes. Different types of taxes are collected in different ways and in varying amounts. The method that is used most to collect taxes is charging a percentage of the amount involved. Taxes that an individual has to pay directly to the government are called direct taxes. Several types of direct taxes are given below. • Rates • Customs duty • Income tax    Taxes that are not charged directly are called indirect taxes. Value added tax (VAT) is one such tax that is charged at present. Rates are taxes charged by urban councils, municipal councils, provincial councils etc., from households and businesses that come within their administrative domain. These taxes are used for various purposes such as the maintenance of roads and street lights, garbage collection and disposal etc. Properties owned by individuals and businesses are assessed annually by the government, and the relevant council charges a percentage of the assessed annual value of the property as rates. This is calculated annually and can be paid in total at the beginning of the year, or in 4 equal quarterly installments once every three months. A house of assessed annual value Rs. 36 000 is charged annual rates of 4%. Calculate the rates that have to be paid for a quarter.                 The assessed annual value of a shop within the administrative domain of a certain urban council is Rs. 24 000. The quarterly rates payable on this property is Rs. 300. Calculate the rates percentage charged by the council.  Assessed annual value of the shop = Rs. 24 000  Rates charged for a quarter = Rs. 300  Rates charged for the year = Rs. 300 = Rs. 1 200  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When certain items are imported or exported, a certain percentage of the value of the item has to be paid as taxes to the government. Such taxes are called customs duty. This tax is charged by Sri Lanka Customs. Individuals who have worked abroad are entitled to a duty free quota on their return, which may be used to purchase certain items without paying customs duty, from the duty free shops housed in the international airport. Further, certain government servants are entitled to a reduction in customs duty when importing vehicles. If customs duty of 10% of the value of the item has to be paid when a certain type of clock is imported, how much duty has to be paid when a clock of this type of value Rs. 5 000 is imported?                          When a car is imported, 60% of its value has to be paid as customs duty. Find the total amount with the duty included, that it costs a person to import a car worth Rs. 2 000 000.

                                                          The government imposes a tax on the annual income of an individual, which is earned as salary, from property or through a business, and which exceeds a certain limit. Such taxes are called income taxes. The income tax for a particular year can either be paid annually or in quarterly installments. A table with the information on how the taxes are calculated, which was implemented in 2011 by the Inland Revenue Department is given below. (These values may change in the future) Initial Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Balance taxable income Tax Percentage Tax free 4% 8% 12% 16% 20% 24% This table is used to perform calculations related to the examples and problems on income tax in this lesson. If the annual income of an individual is Rs. 575 000, calculate the income tax he has to pay for the year.  The annual income = Rs. 575 000  Tax free income = Rs. 500 000  Taxable income = Rs. 575 000 − 500 000                 If the annual income of a certain businessman is Rs. 1 650 000, calculate the total annual income tax he has to pay.

The annual income of a certain individual is Rs. 550 000. How much income tax does he have to pay according to the income tax rates implemented in year 2011 (table 13.1)? 13. If a businessman paid an annual income tax of Rs. 56 000 in 2012 according to the income tax rates implemented in 2011 (table 13.1), what is his annual income? When a loan has been taken from an individual or an institution, the extra amount that has to be paid when settling the loan after a period of time is called the interest. Similarly, when money has been deposited in a bank or some other financial institution for a period of time, the extra amount that is received at the end of the period is also called the interest. Usually, the interest that has to be paid for a year is a percentage of the loan amount (or deposit amount). This percentage is called the annual interest rate. The interest rate can also be given monthly or semi-annually. When calculating the interest for a specific period, if only the initial amount (principal) is taken into consideration, then such interest is called simple interest. It took a man 2 years to settle a loan of Rs. 5 000 borrowed at an annual simple interest rate of 10%. How much interest did he pay in total?  Simple interest paid for two years = Rs. 500 = Rs. 1 000      as follows. Import price of vehicle  Customs duty  Port charges and transportation cost    = Rs. 600 000 = Rs. 400 000 = Rs. 50 000 If VAT of 15% was charged on all these expenses, how much did he have to pay in total for the vehicle? 16. VAT of 15% is added to the monthly water bill of a household. If Prathapa pays a total of Rs. 1 725 as his monthly water bill, find the value of the bill without the VAT.                Find the total amount that Senal has to pay to settle a loan in three months, if he borrowed Rs. 8 000 at a monthly simple interest rate of 2%. = Rs. 8 000 = Rs. 160 = Rs. 160 = Rs. 480 Since total amount = Loan + Interest, = Rs. 8 000 + 480 = Rs. 8 480    How long will it take for a person who gave a loan of Rs 10 000 at an annual simple interest rate of 12%, to receive an interest of Rs. 3 600? Number of years it takes to receive Rs. 3 600 as interest If the simple interest that had to be paid for two years, on a loan of Rs.7 500 was Rs.1 200, find the annual simple interest rate that was charged.  Interest for two years  Interest for a year = Rs.1 200 = Rs.1 200 2 = Rs.600 = 600 7500  Example 5 How many years after taking a loan of Rs. 25 000 at an annual simple interest rate of 7.5%, does a person have to pay a total amount of Rs. 28 750 to settle the loan? = Rs. 1 875 Loan = Rs. 25 000  Total amount to be paid = Rs. 28 750         7.5 100                                                                  Example 6 If the total amount that had to be paid after 4 months to settle a loan borrowed at a monthly simple interest rate of 1.5% was Rs.5 300, find the loan amount. The meaning of “A monthly simple interest rate of 1.5%” is that “Rs.1.50 has to be paid as interest for a month for a loan amount of Rs 100.  That is, interest paid for 1 month on a loan of Rs.100 = Rs'1.50  Interest paid for 4 months on a loan of Rs. 100 = Rs'1.50 « 4 = Rs'6  Total amount paid in 4 months for a loan of Rs. 100 = Rs'100 + 6 = Rs'106  Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs'106 = Rs'100  has to be paid after 4 months  Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs. 5300 =  has to be paid after 4 months  
 
 
2. A man deposits Rs.50 000 in a bank at a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. If he withdraws the interest he receives monthly, how much interest does he get in total during a period of 6 months? 5. If a person who gave a loan of Rs. 6 000 at an annual simple interest rate, received Rs.3 600 as interest for four years, what is the annual simple interest rate that was charged?                        8. At what annual simple interest rate should a loan of Rs.5 000 be given to receive the same interest that is received when a loan of Rs.6 000 is given at an annual simple interest rate of 8%? 13. A person takes a loan of Rs.5 000, promising to pay interest at a monthly simple interest rate of 5%. How much does he have to pay in total to settle the loan in 6 months? 16. A person takes a loan on annual simple interest, promising to settle the loan in two years by paying Rs.5 000. However he was only able to settle the loan in 5 years, at which time he had to pay Rs.6 500.  (i) Calculate the interest he has paid for a year.  (ii) What was the amount he borrowed?  (iii) What was the annual simple interest rate that was charged?  (i) Write down an expression for the interest he has to pay for a month.  (ii) Write down an expression for the total interest I that he has to pay for a   Let us work on the following exercise in order to revise the knowledge we have acquired on solving simple equations. Did you observe that some of the equations in the above exercise contain fractions. The unknown term (x, y, p, a) was in the numerator of the fraction?. Now we are going to construct and solve equations with fractions of which the unknown term is in the denominator. Let us construct and solve such an equation. Twelve is divided by two numbers of which the value of one number is double that of the other. The difference between the two quotients is 2. Find the two numbers. ² construct and solve simple equations with algebraic fractions ² construct and solve simultaneous equations ² solve quadratic equations using factors     Thus, the problem can be solved using the method of trial and error. However, for some problems, the trial and error method is too long. Also, some problems cannot be solved by trial and error method. A suitable method of solving this type of problems is by using equations. Now, let us see how it can be solved by constructing an equation. Suppose 12 is divided by a number x and its double 2x. Then the quotient of 12 divided by x is The value of x obtained by solving this equation gives us the required number. Let us solve this equation. This is an equation having fractions with algebraic terms in the denominator. The first fraction contains x in the denominator. The second fraction has 2x in the denominator. Let us make the denominators of both fractions  by the equivalent fraction equal. The easiest way to do this is by replacing      Note:This equation can be solved by writing the equation cross multiplication too. Several friends shared 60 mangoes equally. One of them, Amal, sold three of his mangoes, and then he had only two mangoes left. How many friends shared the mangoes? In reality, this problem can easily be solved mentally. Nevertheless, let us solve this equation as follows just to illustrate the construction and solving of equations. Let x be the number of friends. Then, the number of mangoes one person obtains = Let us now solve this equation. Let us add 3 to both sides.  Then, 5x = 60  Hence, x = 12.                   1. A father and his sons equally shared an amount of Rs 270. Then the amount each person had was Rs 45. Taking the number of sons as x, construct an equation. Solve this equation and hence find the number of sons the father has. 2. When the same number was added both to the numerator and the denominator of , the resulting fraction was equal to 9 ' What number was added?        The coefficient of the unknown x in each of the equations is 2. That means, they are equal. We have seen how to solve simultaneous equations of this nature, i.e., when the coefficients of one unknown are equal. Let us see how simultaneous equations are solved when the coefficients of both unknowns are un equal, i.e., the coefficients of each unknown are different. Sajithi and Sanjana have certain amounts of money. When twice the amount of money Sanjana has is added to the amount of money Sajithi has, we get Rs. 110. When thrice the amount of money Sanjana has is added to twice the amount of money Sajithi has, the amount is Rs. 190. Find the amount of money each has. Let us see how simultaneous equations can be used to solve this problem. Let the amount of money Sajithi has be Rs. x and the amount of money Sanjana has be Rs. y. Then, the sum of the amount of money Sajithi has and twice the amount of money Sanjana has is Rs. x + 2y. Because this amount is equal to Rs. 110, we get Also, the sum of twice the amount of money Sajithi has and thrice the amount of money Sanjana has is Rs. 2x + 3y. Because this amount is equal to Rs 190, we get The coefficients of neither x nor of y of the equations (1) and (2) are equal. Therefore, let us equate the coefficients of one of the unknowns. In order to make the coefficient of x in the first equation 2, let us multiply that equation by 2. Then we get Now, the coefficients of x in both equations are equal. Therefore, from 3 and 2 , we get,  2x + 4y – (2x + 3y) = 220 – 190  2x + 4y – 2x – 3y = 30  y = 30 Substituting the value of y in the first equation,                         Therefore, the amount of money Sajithi has is Rs 50 and the amount of money Sanjana has is Rs 30. The price of two oranges and one king coconut is Rs. 80. Three king coconuts cost the same amount as two oranges. Find the price of an orange and a king coconut separately.  From 1 × 3, we get, 6m + 9n = 39  From 2 × 2, we get, 6m + 10n = 42 Then, from 4 and 3 , we get, et us denote the two equations as 1 2 2m + 3n = 13 3m + 5n = 21 Solve: 2m + 3n = 13 3m + 5n = 21  6m + 10n – (6m + 9n) = 42 – 39  6m + 10n – 6m – 9n = 3  n = 3 Substituting n = 3 in (1), we get 2m + 3n = 13 2m + 3×3 = 13  2m = 13 – 9  2m = 4 m = 2 i.e., m = 2 and n = 3           Then, the price of two oranges and a king coconut is 2x + y. Since this is equal to Rs. 80, we get  2x + y = 80  2x = 3y 1 2 These two equations can be solved just the way we did in the previous example, by writing the second equation as 2x – 3y = 0. However, there is an easier way to do it in this case. That is, substituting from one equation to the other. 3y + y = 80  4y = 80  y = 20 Substitute y = 20 in (1) to get  2x + 20 = 80  2x = 60  x = 30       Solve: x = 3y  2x + 3y = 18 Denote the two equations as  x = 3y 2x + 3y = 18 Substitute for x in equation (2) from equation (1) to get 2 « (3y) + 3y = 18  6y + 3y = 18  9y = 18  y = 2 Substitute y = 2 in (1) to get          
x = 3y x = 3 « 2 x = 6 i.e., x = 6 and y = 2.              An equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation where a ≠ 0. The terms b and c might be 0. Observe the following equations.  ^i& x2 + 5x + 6 = 0  ^ii& 2x2 – 5x = 0 ^iii& x2 – 9 = 0 Each of the above equations is a quadratic equation since a ≠ 0, whereas c = 0 in the second equation and b = 0 in the third equation. Before solving the quadratic equations, let us consider the following:  • When any number is multiplied by zero, the product is zero. • If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers is zero. So, let us see for what values of x the expression (x – 1)(x – 3) is zero. The expression is zero only when x – 1= 0 or x – 3 = 0, that is, only when x =1 or x = 3. ^a& x + 2y = 10 2x – 5y = 2  ^e& 2x + 5y = 9 3x + 2y = 8  ^f& 4m – 3n = 7 7m – 2n = 22  ^j& 3x – 4y = 8 ^2 – y& + 1 2 ^2x + 3y & = 26 – y   ^c& 2m + n = 5  m + 2n = 4   ^d& 3x + y = 14 2x + 3y = 21  ^h& 6x + 5y = 5 9x – 4y = 19  2. The price of two baby shirts and three pairs of baby shorts is Rs. 1150. Three baby shirts and a pairs of baby shorts cost Rs. 850. Taking the price of a baby shirt as Rs. x and that of a pairs of baby shorts as Rs. y, construct two simultaneous equations and find the price of a baby shirt and that of a pairs of baby shorts separately by solving the two equations. 3. Dinithi’s father tells Dinithi, “My age is now four times your age. 8 years earlier, I was twelve times older than you.” Find the present ages of the father and Dinithi separately.         Now, consider the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0. Since x2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2), the equation can be rewritten as (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0. Then, x + 3 = 0 or x + 2 = 0. There fore, x = –3 and x = –2 satisfy the equation. This can be verified as follows. When x = –3,  = 9 + ^–15& + 6  = 0 When x = –2,  x2 + 5x +6 = ^–2&2 + 5^–2& + 6  = 4 +^–10& + 6  = 0 Thus, the roots of the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are –3 and –2. In other words, the solutions of the equation are x = –3 and x = –2.  x2 + 2x = 0  x ^x + 2& = 0  x = 0 or x + 2 = 0  x = 0 or x = – 2 Hence, x = 0 and x = –2 are the solutions of the given equation.  Example 2 Solve the equation x2 – 3x + 2 = 0  x2 – 3x + 2 = 0  ^x – 1& ^x – 2& = 0  x – 1 = 0 or x – 2 = 0 x = 1 or x = 2                Example 3 Solve the equation x2 – 4x – 21 = 0  ^x – 7& ^x + 3& = 0 x – 7 = 0 or x + 3 = 0  x = 7 or x = – 3 Hence, x = 7 and x = – 3 are the solutions of the given equation. Note: When there are two factors to a quadratic expression, there are two distinct roots to the that equation.  ^a& ^x – 2& ^ x – 3& = 0 ^c& ^x – 4& ^ x – 4& = 0 ^e& x ^ x + 3& = 0 ^g& x2 – 16 = 0 ^i& 9x2 – 27x = 0 ^k& 2x2 – 5x + 2 = 0 ^m& 2x2 = 6x ^o& ^x + 3&2 = 16 ^q& ^2x – 3&2 = 0 ^s& ^x – 1& ^ x – 2& = 2x2 – 3x – 2                            ^b& ^ x + 2& ^ x – 5& = 0 ^d& ^x – 1& ^ 2x – 1& = 0 ^f& y ^2y – 3& = 0 ^h& 4x2 – 1 = 0 ^j& x2 + 15x + 36 = 0 ^l& 2x2 – 5x = 0 ^n& x2 = 25 ^p& x2 = 9x + 36 ^r& 2x2 – 5x = 0 ^t&   A closed plane figure bounded by four straight line segments is called a quadrilateral.

By studying this lesson, you will be able to • identify methods of describing sets • identify the regions in a Venn diagram when at most two sets are represented in the Venn diagram and solve problems using the formula     • the descriptive method • the method of listing elements • the Venn diagram method. Let A be the set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10. Then, A can be denoted using the above three methods as follows: • As a description,  A = {multiples of 3 between 1 and 10} or  A = set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10. • Listing the elements A = {3, 6, 9} • In a Venn diagram, Set builder method is another method to describe sets. The set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10 can be denoted using the set builder method as follows: The symbol x here is like a variable. You may use any symbol in place of x. The statement after the colon describes how the elements should be. There are several ways a set can be represented using the set builder method. For example, the following are three different ways of denoting the set A = {1, 2} using the set builder method.      3 6 9                A = { x : (x – 1) (x – 2) = 0 } A = { y : A = {n 1. Describe the set of all positive integers from10 to 15 using  (i) the descriptive method  (ii) the listing method  (iii) a Venn diagram  (iv) the set builder method. 2. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.  (i) A = {3, 6, 9, 12} 3. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.  i. X = {All letters in the word “ANURADHAPURA”}  ii. A = {x : x is a prime number and 10 < x < 20}  A = {Positive integers less than 10} A = {x: x  or  C 3                       In Venn diagrams, the universal set is represented by a rectangular region and is denoted by ε.  ε  The subsets of the universal set are represented by circular (or elliptical) regions. These subsets give rise to several regions in the Venn diagram that represents the universal set. Now let us investigate these regions. The subset A divides the universal set into two regions which are shaded in the next figure.The subsets corresponding to these regions can be denoted by A and A using set notation. 4. Describe each of the following sets using a Venn diagram.  (i) A = {7, 14, 21, 28}  (ii) B = {Vowels in the English alphabet}  : x2 = 4}  (iii) Y = {x 5' Describe each of the following sets using the set builder method'  (i) X = {Odd numbers between 1 and 10}  (ii) Y = {0" 1" 2" 3}                                         Let A and B be the two subsets. When there are no common elements in A and B, that is, when A∩B = O , and when there are common elements in A and B, that is when A∩B O, the relevant Venn diagrams are shown below.   A B Before investigating the regions let us recall the following definitions.  A = Set of elements not in A  = Set of elements belonging to both A and B  = Set of elements belonging to A or B (or both) As an example, let us take ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}  A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and  B = {2, 3, 5, 7}  = {2} and  = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}  (  ( 180  ) = {1, 9} and ) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}                                        Two subsets of a universal set represented in a Venn diagram give rise to several regions' Some such regions and the way they can be written down using set complement, set intersection and set union are shown below.        (i) A ∩B  (iii) (A∩B)  (v) (A∩B) (vii) (A ∩B) (viii) (A  (ix) (A B)    
 (ii) A B  (iv) (A B)  (A B) (vi) (A∩B )  B )  (i) A∩B (iii) A ∩B  (v) (A B)  (ii) A B (iv) A  B (vi) (A ∩B) 3. The information on the children in a society is shown in the following Venn diagram. (The letters a, b, c and d indicate the regions in which the letters are written.) Age above 10 years Describe in words the regions indicated by each of the letters a, b, c and d. For example, the boys whose ages are above 10 years are indicated by a. 4. Let ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}  A ∩B = {4, 5}  A∩B = {3}  (A B) = {1}  Include the above information in a suitable Venn diagram and hence find A, A B and B ∩A.           Shown below is a Venn diagram with two subsets A and B of the universal set such that A∩B O. Here n1, n2 and n3 denote the number of elements in the respective regions. (Though it is expected to write the elements inside the regions, we have written down the number of elements for ease.) Let us the denote the number of elements belonging to the subset A by n(A) etc. Then, from the figure, we see that  n (A) = n1 + n2  n (B) = n2 + n3  n (A∩B) = n2  n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n3 Now, we write, n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n2 + n3 – n2     The Venn diagram when the two subsets A and B are disjoint (i.e.,when A∩B = O ) is shown below. In this case, we see that n (A) = n1 n (B) = n2  n (A∪B) = n1 + n2                 Information on the numbers of students who participate in football and cricket are shown in the following diagram (In this case too, the numbers in the regions indicate the numbers of students in the regions). How many students are 1. participating in football? n (F) = 8 +7 = 15 2. participating in cricket? n (C) = 7 + 15 = 22 3. participating in both sports (both football and cricket)? n (F ∩ C) = 7 4. participating in cricket only? n (C ∩ F ) = 15 5. participating in football only? n (F ∩ C ) = 8 6. participating in football or cricket (or both)? n (F ∪ C) = 8 + 7 + 15 = 30 7. not participating in football? n (F ) = 15 + 5 = 20 8. not participating in cricket? n (C ) = 8 + 5 = 13 9. participating in exactly in one of the two sports? n {(F ∩ C ) ∪ (F ∩ C )}        The information obtained through a survey from a set of farmers in a certain village about the kind of crop they grow in their farms is shown in the following Venn diagram. Football  (F) Cricket  (C)                1. vegetables? n (Y) = 25 2. paddy? n (X) = 7 + 25 = 32 3. only paddy? n (Y ∩X) = 7 4. only vegetables? n(X ∩Y) = 0 5. both vegetables and paddy? n (X∩Y) = 25 6. vegetables or paddy? n (X∪Y) = 7 + 25 = 32 7. neither of the two crops? n (X∪Y) = 13     Exercise 18.3 1. Find n(A∪B) if n (A) = 35, n (B) = 24, n(A∩B) = 11.  Find n(P), n(Q), n(P ∩ Q), n(P ∪ Q) and verify the formula  n(P ∪ Q) = n(P) + n(Q) – n(P ∩ Q) 6.

Thilini Sewwandi - Educational Publications Department - Educational Publications Department              This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus to be implemented from 2015. Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to read and understand it on your own. We have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official Languages. Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject content in the grade 10 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the begin- ning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them for the subject content of grade 10. You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and do- ing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them in the classroom. We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience.     21. Graphs 22. Rate  20 43            Let us now consider how simplifications are facilitated by using the properties of indices. To do this, let us use the table of powers of 2 given below. Power of 2 Value 2x 1 21 2 22 4 23 8 24 16 25 32 26 28 27 64 128 256 29 210 512 1024     It can be seen that the above simplification was done easily and concisely by using the laws of indices. In the above example it was possible to write the numbers as powers of 2. Any expression containing the multiplication and division of numbers can easily be simplified using the logarithm tables. John Napier (1550 A.D. -1617 A.D.) a Scottish mathematician is bestowed with the honour of introducing the logarithm tables first. Briggs another mathematician who was a contemporary of Napier developed logarithms further. Although the use of the logarithm tables has reduced in recent years due to the widespread use of calculators, it is very important to learn the mathematical concepts related to logarithms. We know that 23 = 8. Here 8 is expressed as a power with base 2 and index 3. Such expressions are defined as '' index form''. This can also be expressed as the logarithm of 8 to base 2 is 3. This is written as log28 = 3, which is defined as the ''logarithm form''. It must be clear to you that the same statement is written in index form and in logarithm form. Accordingly, since 23 = 8, we also have log2 8 = 3. Similarly, log2 8 = 3, means 23 = 8. Let us consider several other examples. • Since 32 = 9, the logarithm of 9 to base 3 is 2. That is, log3 9 = 2. • Since 51 = 5, the logarithm of 5 to base 5 is 1. That is, log5 5 = 1. • Since103 = 1000, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3. That is, log10 1000 = 3. In general, for a positive number a, ax = N is considered as the index form and loga N = x is considered as the logarithm form. Here a and N take only positive values. (Since any power of a positive number is positive, in the above relationship, when a is positive, N is also positive.) Accordingly, when considering logarithms, the base always takes a positive value. That is, logaa = 1. This is because a1 = a. For example, log2 2 = 1 and log10 10 = 1' (ii) The logarithm of 1 to any base (other than 1) is 0. That is, loga1 = 0. This is because a0 = 1. For example, log21 = 0 and log101 = 0' We observe that so far we have obtained positive values for the logarithms. However, logarithms can also be negative. The logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is always negative. For example,  1. Write each of the following expressions in logarithm form.  (i) The logarithm of 32 to base 2 is 5.  (ii) The logartihm of 1000 to base 10 is 3. (iii) The logarithm of x to base 2 is y. (iv) The logarithm of q to base p is r.  (v) The logarithm of r to base q is p. Let us recall again how the value of 16 × 32 can be obtained by writing it in index form. = 24 « 25 = 24 + 5 = 29  Let us now consider 16 « 32 = 24 + 5. Let us convert this to logarithm form.  16 « 32 = 24 + 5 (Index form)  log2^16 « 32& = 4 + 5 (Logarithm form) Similarly, since 27 « 81 = 33 « 34 = 33 + 4,  log3^27 « 81& = 3 + 4'  log10^10 « 100& = log1010 ¬ log10100 and  log5^125 « 25& = log5125 ¬ log525' As seen above, when multiplying powers, an important fact about the behaviour of logarithms is highlighted. This is true in general for any product of powers and is expressed as follows. 2. Express each of the following in index form.  (i) log5125 = 3  (ii) log10100 000 = 5  (v) loga1 = 0  (iv) logpa = q 3. Express each of the following in logarithm form.  (i) 28 = 256  (iv) 202 = 400  (ii) 104 = 10000  (v) ax = y     (iii) logax = y (vi) logmm = 1 (iii) 73 = 343 (vi) pa = q 4. Solve each of the following equations.  (i) log3243 = x  (ii) log10100 = x  (iv) logx25 = 2  (v) logx64 = 6 (viii) log10x = 4 (vii) log3x = 2 5. (i) Write 64 as a power of four different bases.  (ii) Find four distinct pairs of values for x and y such that logx 64 = y. (iii) log6216 = x (vi) logx10 = 1  (ix) log8x = 2                This statement can also be expressed as “the logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of the logarithms”. Such a formula exists for the logarithm of a quotient too. Let us investigate this now. Let us consider the following example. Let us recall how the value of 128 ÷ 16 is obtained by converting it into index form. As seen above, when dividing powers, an important fact about the behaviour of logarithms is highlighted. This is true in general for any quotient of powers and is expressed as follows. These properties are called ''Laws of Logarithms.'' Now let us learn how to solve problems using these laws of logarithms by considering the following examples.    2 4 Express in terms of loga 2 and loga 3.  (i) loga6 (ii) loga18      (ii) log38 + log35  (v) loga10 – loga2 – loga5 (vi) log106 + log102 – log103 1. Simplify and express the answer as a single logarithm.  (i) log210 + log25  (iv) log620 – log64 2. Find the value of each of the following expressions.  (ii) log327 – log33  (i) log24 + log28  (iv) log280 – log215 + log212  (iii) log1020 + log102 – log104  (v) log1020 + log1010 – log102  (vi) log520 + log54 – log516 3. Write the following expressions in terms of loga5 and loga3.   4. Solve the following equations.  (i) log25 + log23 = log2x  (iii) log320 + log3x = log34 + log310  (v) log108 + log10x – log102 = log1012  (ii) loga10 + logax = loga30 (iv) loga15 – loga3 = logax (vi) log524 – log54 = log52 + log5x            4. Evaluate.  (i) log10 200 + log10300 – log1060 5. Solve.  (i) log10x – log102 = log103 – log104 + 1  (ii) log212 – log23 = log2x + 1   Let us recall several facts we have learnt earlier regarding logarithms. Since 10o = 1, we obtain log10 1 = 0. That is, the logarithm of 1 to base 10 is 0. Since 101 = 10, we obtain log10 10 = 1. That is, the logarithm of 10 to base 10 is 1. Since 102 = 100, we obtain log10 100 = 2. That is, the logarithm of 100 to base 10 is 2. Since 103 = 1000, we obtain log10 1000 = 3. That is, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3. The following table has been prepared accordingly. This table provides the logarithm of the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 to base ten. Logarithm values exist for numbers between 0 and 1, between 1 and 10, between 10 and 100 etc also. These values are not whole numbers. The Scottish mathematician Henry Briggs who lived about four centuries ago prepared the logarithms table by calculating these values. He included only the logarithms of numbers from 1 up to 10. Below is given part of this logarithms table. 1875 0086 0492 0864 1206 1523 1903 0128 0531 0899 1239 1553 0170 0569 0934 1271 1584 0212 0607 0969 1303 1614 0253 0645 1004 1335 1644 2014 0334 0334 0334 0334 0334 3 0374 0755 1106 1430 0732 1987 0294 0682 1038 1367 1673 Mean difference 7 5 2 6 4 4 3 3 3 8 8 8 7 6 6 12 17 21 25 29 33 37 11 15 19 23 26 30 34 10 14 17 21 24 33 31 10 13 16 19 23 26 29 12 15 18 21 24 27 9 0000 0414 0792 1139 1461 0043 0453 0828 1173 1492 10 11 12 13 14 0170 0569 0934 1271 2 1584 0212 0607 0969 1303 3 1614 0253 0645 1004 1335 4 1644 0294 0682 1038 1367 6 1673 4 4 3 3 3 0374 0755 1106 1430 8 0732 0334 0334 0334 0334 7 0334 8 8 7 6 6 1 12 17 21 25 29 33 37 11 15 19 23 26 30 34 10 14 17 21 24 33 31 10 13 16 19 23 26 29 Mean difference 12 15 18 21 24 27 9 3 7 5 2 10 11 12 13 14 0000 0414 0792 1139 1461 0043 0453 0828 1173 1492 0086 0492 0864 1206 1523 0128 0531 0899 1239 1 1553  The numbers represented in the leftmost column under N by 10, 11, 12, …, 99 are 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, … , 9.9 which are from 1 up to 10. The decimal point (.) which should be placed in these numbers has not been indicated in the logarithms table. (This has been done to simplify the table). However, when using the table, the decimal point should be placed in the correct position. In the uppermost row, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, …, 9 have been written from left to right, and in the same row, on the right, the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 9 have been written under the mean difference. As an example the 29th row of the table is given below. In this row, the value in the 6th column is 4713. As mentioned earlier, the decimal point of the numbers is not written. But, when using the table, the decimal point should be placed in the correct position. That is, the value is 0.4713. This means that, the logarithm of 2.96 to base 10 is 0.4713. This also means that 100.4713 = 2.96. That is, when 2.96 is written as a power of ten it is 100.4713. Using the logarithms table we can find the logarithm of numbers consisting of up to 4 digits. When writing logarithms to base 10, instead of writing log10 we write lg in short. Example: log10 100 = 2 is written as lg 100 = 2. Note that to find the logarithm of 2.9, it must be written as 2.90. The value corresponding to the 29th row and the column indicated by 0 must be taken as the logarithm of 2.90; that is 0.4624. This is written as, log 10 2.9 = 0.4624 or lg 2.9 = 0.4624. Writing this in index form we obtain 2.9 = 10 0.4624. Let us identify how lg 4.58 is obtained using the logarithms table. The value that belongs to the row containing 45 which are the first two digits of 4.58 and the column containing 8, which is the remaining digit, is 0.6609. This value is the required logarithm. That is, the logarithm of 4.58 = lg 4.58 = 0.6609 Writing this in index form we obtain 4.58 = 100.6609.  Find the logarithm of each of the following numbers using the logarithms table. Indicate the relevant index form too. (i) 6'85 (ii) 3'4    (i) lg 6'85 = 0'8357" in index form 6.85 =100.8357  (ii) lg 3'4 = 0'5315" in index form 3'4 = 100'5315 ^Writing 3'4 as 3'40& (iii) lg 8 = 0'9031" in index form 8 = 100'9031 1. Using the logarithms table, find the logarithm of each of the following numbers.  Indicate the relevant index form too. (iii) 9.99  (ii) 1.05  (i) 7.32  (vi) 3.1 (vii) 4 (viii) 7 (iv) 5.8 (ix) 1 (x) 1.01  We now know how to obtain the logarithm of a number with up to two decimal places which lies between 1 and 10. Next let us consider how the logarithm of a number with three decimal places which lies between 1 and 10 is found. Let us identify how the logarithm of 5.075 which is a number with three decimal places is found using the table. The number 7050 is obtained from the table as the value which belongs to the row containing 50, which are the first two digits of 5.075, and the column containing 7 which is the third digit of this number. The mean difference in the same row, under the column containing 5, which is the fourth digit of 5.075 is 4. Mean difference 2 4 5 Now add 4 to 7050. Then since 7050 + 4 = 7054, we obtain lg 5.075 = 0.7054. The index form of this is 5.075 = 100.7054. Using the logarithms table, find the logarithm of each of the following numbers and then write each number in index form. 12 For free distribution           (ii) lg 5.875 = 0.7690" in index form 5.875 = 100.7690. (iii) lg 9.071= 0.9576" in index form 9.071 = 100.9576. Although only the logarithms of numbers from 1 up to 10 are included in the logarithms table, the logarithm of any other number (up to four digits or rounded off up to four digits) can also be found using the table. Now let us consider the strategy that is used in such a case. Find the logarithm of 54.37 Method (i): lg 54'37 = lg (5'437 × 101) (Representing in scientific notation) = 0'7354 + 1 (From the logarithms table and since lg 10 = 1) = 1'7354  54'37 = 5'437 × 101  =  100'7354 × 101 (Writing the value that is obtained from the table 0.7354 as an index of 10)  Find the logarithm of each of the following numbers.  (i) 8'583 (ii) 85'83 (iii) 858'3 (iv) 8583 lg 8'583 = lg ^ 8'583 « 100 & = lg 8.583 + lg 100 = 0'9337 + 0 = 0'9337  (i) lg 85'83 = lg ^ 8'583 « 101 & = lg 8.583 + lg 101 = 0'9337 + 1 = 1'9337  (ii) lg 858'3 = lg ^ 8'583 « 102 & = lg 8.583 + lg 102 = 0'9337 + 2 = 2'9337 (iii) (iv) lg 8583 = lg ^ 8'583 « 103 & = lg 8.583 + lg 103 = 0'9337 + 3 = 3'9337 Using the logarithms table, find the logarithm of each of the following numbers and then write each number in index form.                              (The decimal part of these logarithms remains the same since what is obtained from the table in each instance is the value in the 85th row, the 8th column and the 3rd mean difference column). In the logarithm 1.9337 of 85.83 in the above example, the decimal part of the logarithm is called the mantissa and the whole number 1 which is on the left of the decimal point is called the characteristic of the logarithm.  8.583  85.83  858.3  Number of digits in the integral part  1  2  3 Scientific Notation  Logarithm Characteristic of the logarithm  8.583 × 100  8.583 × 101  8.583 × 102  0.9337  1.9337  2.9337  0  1  2 According to the table, the characteristic of the logarithm of a number is the index of the power of ten, in the expression obtained when the number is expressed in scientific notation. For numbers which are larger than 1, the characteristic of the logarithm is one less than the number of digits in the integral part of the number. Accordingly, for numbers such as 5.673 which have just one digit in the integral part, the characteristic is 0. Find the logarithm of each number using the logarithms table. Write each number in index form too.  (i) 69.34 (ii) 957.1 (iii) 1248 (i) lg 69.34 = 1.8409" in index form 69.34 = 101.8409 (ii) lg 957.1 = 2.9809, in index form 957.1 = 102.9809 (iii) lg 1248 = 3.0962, in index form 1248 = 103.0962 2. If 100.8939 = 7.832, find each of the following values.  (i) lg 7.832 (ii) lg 78.32 (iii) lg 7832  According to the logarithms table, lg 59.3 = 1.7731. That is, the logarithm of 59.3 is 1.7731 . Another way of saying this is that 1.7731 is the logarithm of 59.3. Then we say that the antilogarithm of 1.7731 is 59.3. We write this as antilog 1.7731 = 59.3. Now let us consider how the antilogarithm is obtained when the mean difference section is also involved. 7 8432 Mean difference 6 7 2 3 4 5 antilog 0.8436 = 6.976 We can describe how the antilogarithm of 0.8436 was found using the above table as follows. Since this value is not in the table, we consider the number in the table which is less than this and closest to it. This value is 8432 which lies in the 69th row and 7th column. The difference 4 (= 8436 – 8432) is in the 6th column of the mean difference section. Accordingly, the required antilogarithm is 6.976 . (Since the characteristic of 0.8436 is 0 there is only one digit in the integral part of the antilog) When the characteristic of the logarithm is 0, the antilogarithm can be written directly from the table as in the above example, as a number between 1 and 10. However when the characteristic is greater than 0, the antilog can be found as shown in the following example. Find the value of antilog 1.8436 antilog 1.8436 = 6.976×101 (6.971 from the mantissa and 1 in 101 from the characteristic) Find using the logarithms table.

Evaluate using the logarithms table. ^i& 4.975 × 10.31 Let us take P = 4.975 × 10.31 Then, lg P = lg (4.975 × 10.31)  = lg 4.975 + lg 10.31 (Logarithm laws) = 0.6968 + 1.0132 = 1.7100 = 51.28 4.975 × 10.31 = 51.28   This product can also be obtained using the index laws 4.975 × 10.31 = 100.6968 × 101.0132 (From the logarithms table)  = 100.7100 « 101  = 5.128 « 101 1.

  The graph of a function of the form y = mx + c is a straight line. The coefficient of x, which is m, represents the gradient of the line and the constant term c represents the intercept of the graph. We defined the coefficient m of x in the equation y = mx + c as the gradient of the straight line. Now by considering an example, let us see how the value of m is represented geometrically. To do this, let us consider the straight line given by y = 2x + 1. Let us use the following table of values to draw its graph. x y (= 2x + 1) – 2 – 3 0 1 2 5   • find the gradient of the graph of a straight line, • draw the graph of a function of the form y = ax2 + b.  Let us mark any three points on the straight line. For example, let us take the three points as A (0, 1), B (2, 5) and C (5, 11). y C ^5" 11& First let us consider the points A and B. Let us draw a line from A, parallel to the x – axis, and a line from B, parallel to the y – axis, and name the point of intersection of these lines as P. It is clear that the coordinates of the point P are (2, 1). Also, length of AP = 2 – 0 Vertical distance Horizontal distance BP AP 4 = = 2 We already know the gradiant of the straight line y = 2x + 1 is 2. The quotient Vertical Distance Horizontal distance Now let us consider another case. As the second case let us consider the points B and C. Let us draw a line from B, parallel to the x - axis, and a line from C, parallel to the y - axis and name the point of intersection of these two lines as Q.  Then the coordinates of Q are (5, 5).  Length of BQ = 5 – 2  = 3 4 3 2 −1 −1 −2 −3 −4 −5       Vertical distance Horizontal distance CQ BQ 6 = = 3 In both instances, the ratio of the vertical distance to the horizontal distance between the two points under consideration is the gradient 2 of the straight line. Accordingly, let us develop a formula to find the gradient of a straight line using its graph. Let us consider any straight line with equation y = mx + c. Let us consider any two points A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2) on the straight line. Since these two points lie on the straight line, 5 4 3 2 1 −1 −1 −2 −3 −4 −5 −6        The coordinates of two points on a straight line are (3, 10) and (2, 6). Find the gradient of the straight line.

The coordinates of a point on the graph is (2, 7). Write the equation of the straight line. By substituing the value of the intercept and the coordinates of the point on the graph into the equation of the function we obtain,  y = mx + c Exercise 21.2 1. For each graph with the given intercept and passing through the given point,  (i) Intercept = 1and (3, 10)  (iii) Intercept = 5 and (2, 1)  (v) Intercept = – 4 and (3, 8)  (ii) Intercept = 2 and (3, 3)  (iv) Intercept = 0 and (3, 12)  (vi) Intercept = –5 and (–2, –9)    Let us find the equation of the straight line which passes through the points (1, 7) and (3, 15). To obtain the equation, let us find the gradient and the intercept of the graph. Let us first find the gradient of the straight line, using the coordinates (1, 7) and (3, 15) of the two points on the line. Let us substitute the value of m and the coordinates of one of the points into the equation y = mx + c. Thereby we can find the value of c. The gradient of the graph is 4 and the intercept is 3. Therefore, the required equation is y = 4x + 3.      Now let us substitute the coordinates of the point (2, –1) and the gradient into the equation y = mx + c. Exercise 21.3 1. Find the equation of each of the straight line graphs that passes through the given Now let us identify several basic properties of graphs of functions of the form y = ax2. Here a is a non-zero number. Here y is defined as the function. y can be considered as a function which is determined by ax2. First let us draw the graph of y = x2. To do this, let us proceed according to the following steps. Step 1 Preparing a table of values to find the y values corresponding to given x values of the function. x x2 y –3 –2 –1 0  0  9  0  9  4  4  1  1  1  1  1  2  4  4  3  9  9 Using the table of values, let us obtain the coordinates of the points required to draw the graph of the function. (–3, 9), (–2, 4), (–1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9) Step 2 Preparing a Cartesian coordinate plane to mark the coordinates that were obtained. 26 For free distribution    The maximum value that the x coordinate takes in the pairs that were obtained is +3 and the minimum value is –3. The maximum value that the y coordinate takes is 9 and the minimum value is 0. Let us draw the x and y axes according to a suitable scale, on the piece of paper that is to be used to draw the graph, so that the x - axis can be calibrated from –3 to 3 and the y - axis can be calibrated from 0 to 9. Step 3 Drawing the graph of the function. Let us mark the seven points on the coordinate plane that has been prepared. Next let us join the points that have been marked so that a smooth curve is obtained. This smooth curve is the graph of the function y = x2. 0 –1 The curve that is obtained as the graph of a function of the form y = ax2 is defined as a parabola. Let us identify several properties of the graph of the function y = x2 by considering the graph that was drawn.  For the function y = x2, • the graph is symmetric about the y - axis.

In the region of the graph below the line y = 6, the y coordinate takes values less than 6. This region of the graph has been indicated by a dark line. Let us draw two lines parallel to the y - axis, from the points of intersection of the graph and the line y = 6, up to the x - axis. Let us mark the two points at which these two lines meet the x - axis (–3 and +3). The interval of values of x between these two points is the interval of values of x for which y < 6' That is, when the value of x is greater than −3 and less than +3, the value of y < 6' Therefore, the interval of values of x for which the function y = x2 – 3 satisfies the condition y < 6 is –3 < x < 3' y  14  Example 1 For the function y = x2 – 4, (i) find the values of x for which (ii) what is the interval of values of x for which the function is increasing positively?

That is, when x = –2 and x = +2, the y coordinate of the graph is 0. Therefore, when x = –2 and x = +2, we have x2 – 4 = 0. That is, x = –2 and x = +2 satisfy the equation x2 – 4 = 0. To put this in another way, the roots of the equation x2 – 4 = 0 are 2 and –2.  (i) Draw the graph of y = x2 – 1'  (ii) Using the graph, find the roots of x2 – 1 = 0' 4.

Then the distance that the car has travelled during 5 seconds is 10 m. If the distance that the car moves forward during each second is the same from the moment it starts, then the distance it travels during each second is metres, that is, 2 metres. Accordingly, as the car moves forward from A, the rate at which the distance changes with respect to time is 2 metres per second. We can define this value as the speed with which the car travels from A to B. If the distance travelled by an object in motion is a constant per unit of time, then the object is said to be travelling with uniform speed. Further, the speed of the object is then the distance travelled per unit of time. From this point on, only objects which travel with uniform speed will be considered in this lesson. However, in reality, vehicles that travel on the main road are usually unable to maintain a uniform speed throughout the whole journey due to the traffic on the road and various other reasons. The instrument called the speedometer gives the speed of a vehicle at any given instance. The speed denoted by the speedometer in the figure can be written as 80 kmph. It can also be written as 80 km /h or as 80 kmh–1. • solve problems related to distance, time and speed • represent information related to distance and time graphically • solve problems related to liquid volumes, time and rate.     As you travel along a main road, you may observe road signs with 40 kmph and 60 kmph written on them to indicate speed limits. Try to recall that heavy vehicles such as lorries carry a board at the back with 40 kmph written on it. For an object that is moving with uniform speed, the relationship between the three quantities, namely the distance travelled, the time taken and the speed can be written as follows. A feather floating on air with uniform speed, drifts 100 m in 20 seconds. Calculate the speed with which the feather drifts. Calculate the distance travelled in one minute by a bird that flies at a uniform speed of 5 ms–1.  Distance it flies = speed « time  = 5 ms–1 « 60 s  = 300 m                                  Calculate the time it takes for a car to travel 150 km on a highway, at a uniform speed of 60 kmh–1. Distance  Speed How far does a motorcycle travel along a main road in 5 seconds, if its speedometer displays a constant speed of 36 kmh–1 during this period? Here, the speed has been given in kilometres per hour. Let us convert it to metres per second. Since the speed is 36 kmh–1,  distance travelled during an hour = 36 km  Distance travelled by the motorcycle in one second = 10 m  Distance travelled in 5 seconds                   
How long does it take a train which is 75 m long to pass a signpost, if it is travelling at a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1? When it reaches the signpost When it reaches the signpost When it passes the signpost When it passes the signpost The distance travelled by the train as it passes the signpost = 75 m First, let us find the speed in terms of metres per second.                                                      The speed of the train is 60 kmh-1.  . .. Distance travelled in one hour = 60 km  Distance travelled in one hour = Find the time it takes for a train of length 60 m travelling at a uniform speed of 72 kmh-1 to cross a bridge which is 100 m long.  60 m  60 m Here, the time taken for the train to travel a distance of 160 m needs to be found. For this, let us first find the speed in metres per second.     = 160 m  Distance travelled by the train in 1 second = 20 m  That is, time taken to travel 20 m = 1 second  . .. Time taken to travel 160 m                                  A vehicle travelling along a main road is usually unable to maintain the same speed throughout the journey. The concept of average speed is important in such situations. The value obtained when the total distance travelled by an object is divided by the total time taken is called the average speed. An intercity bus took an hour to travel the first 25 km of a journey. If it took the bus 1 hour to cover the remaining 80 km of the journey, find the average speed of the bus. Exercise 22.1 1. Calculate the speed of an aircraft which flies 1200 km in 4 hours with uniform 3. On a certain day, an electric train moving at a uniform speed, took 6 hours to travel a distance of 300 km. On another day, the train took 8 hours to travel the same distance. Find the difference between the speeds at which the train travelled during the two days.   A graph can be used to illustrate the change in the distance travelled by an object in motion, with respect to time. In such a graph, the x axis represents the time and the y axis represents the distance travelled. A graph of this form is called a distance-time graph. A table prepared with the information collected by observing the motion of a satellite travelling with uniform speed is given below. Time that has passed from the commencement of the journey (seconds) Distance from the starting point (metres) 9. A train leaves city A at 0800 h and travels at a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1 towards city B. Another train leaves city B at the same instance and travels at a uniform speed of 40 kmh-1 towards city A. If the distance between the two cities A and B is 100 km, calculate the time at which the two trains pass each other. 10. Two motorcyclists, who start their journeys at the same instance from two different cities, travel with uniform speeds of 40 kmh-1 and 50 km-1 respectively towards each other. If they meet each other an hour after commencing their   The speed of the satellite can be calculated by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. 500-300 25-15 200 10 Since the satellite is travelling with uniform speed, the speed can also be obtained by considering the distance travelled per unit of time. Accordingly, you can observe that the gradient of the graph and the speed of the satellite are equal. Therefore, for an object moving with uniform speed, a straight line is obtained as the distance-time graph, and the speed of the object can be obtained from the gradient of this line. A distance-time graph illustrating the motion of Nimal who cycled to his friend’s house and then returned back home after spending some time with his friend is given below.  (i) Calculate the speed at which Nimal cycled to his friend’s house.  (ii) Calculate the speed at which Nimal returned home. ² 0 B ²     B ²  Amount of time Nimal spent at his friend’s house = 20 minutes = 20 minutes                                      1.

A coach, moving with uniform speed from the commencement of its journey, travels a distance of 60 km in 2 hours. It then travels another 40 km in 2 hours, also with uniform speed, and reaches its destination. Represent the motion of the coach in a distance-time graph. city on his motorcycle is given below. Distance (km)  (i) How far is it from his home to the city?  (ii) How long did it take him to reach the city? (iii) Calculate his average speed. D ² C ² B ² 30 Time (Minutes) ² 0  We defined speed as the distance travelled per unit of time. Another way of saying this is that speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. This idea of rate can also be used to describe various other processes that we come across in day to day life. Let us consider the example of water flowing out of a tap. If we collect the water that flows out from a tap during periods of one second each, and if by measuring we discover that the volume of water that flows out during each second is a constant, then we say that the water flows out at a uniform rate. Further, we call this constant value the rate at which water flows out from the tap. When time is measured in seconds and the volume of water is measured in litres, the unit of the rate of flow is litres per second (ls-1). Suppose it takes 20 minutes for a tank of capacity 1000 l to be filled completely using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate. Accordingly, the amount of water that flows out of the pipe per unit of time, that is, during one minute, is 50 litres. Therefore, we can express the rate at which water flows out of the pipe as 50 litres per minute. The time taken for 30 litres of petrol to be pumped into a car through a pump at a certain petrol shed was 60 seconds. Find the rate at which petrol flows out of the pump.                The length, breadth and height of a cuboid shaped indoor water tank are 2 m, and 1 m respectively. On an occasion when the tank was completely filled with water, it took 50 minutes for the tank to be emptied by a pipe. Find the rate at which water flowed out through the pipe. (Assume that the water flowed through the pipe uniformly)  3000 l  50 minutes A saline solution was administered to a patient at a rate of 0.2 mls-1.

If it took 40 minutes to completely fill a cube shaped tank of side length 2 m using a pipe, what is the rate at which water flows through the pipe in litres per minute? (Hint: 1 m3 = 1000 l) 3. How long will it take to fill a fish tank of length 80 cm, breadth 60 cm and height 40 cm using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate of 6 l per minute? (Hint: 1 cm3 = 1 ml) 4. The volume of a tank at a water distribution centre is 1800 m3. If water is distributed from this tank at a rate of 500 ls-1, how many minutes will it take to empty half the tank?           3. The railway stations A and B are 300 km apart. A certain train takes 12 hours to travel from A to B and then back to A, after spending 2 hours at B. Another train leaves station A ten hours after the first train left A, and travels towards B at the same uniform speed. How far has the second train travelled when the two trains pass each other? 1. A cylindrical water tank of cross-sectional area 0.5 m2 is filled to a height of 70 cm in 1 minute and 10 seconds by a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate. Calculate the rate at which water flows out of the pipe. 2. The distance between railway stations X and Y is 420 km. A train leaves station X at 7.00 p.m. and travels towards station Y with a uniform speed of 100 kmh-1 . An hour later, another train leaves station Y and travels towards station X with a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1. At what time do the two trains pass each other?             You may recall that a formula expresses the relationship that exists between two or more physical quantities. If the area of a rectangle is denoted by A, then A can be expressed in terms of the length a and breadth b of the rectangle as A = a « b. A is called the subject of this formula. The subject of a formula can be changed if required. If the above formula is written in the form Do the following exercise to recall the facts you have learnt earlier about changing the subject of a formula. Review Exercise 1. Make u the subject of the formula 3. Consider the formula  ^i& Make a the subject of the formula.  ^ii& Make d the subject of the formula.  ^iii& Make n the subject of the formula.  ^iv& Find the value of d when l = 24" a = 3 and n = 8.  ^i& Make r1 the subject of the above formula.  ^ii& Find the value of r1 when R = 4 and r2= 6. • change the subject of a formula which involves squares and roots. • find the value of an unknown term in a formula when the values of the other unknown terms are given. Given below is the formula for the area of a circle. Here A denotes the area and r denotes the radius of the circle. Let us consider how r is made the subject of this formula. Let us first make r2 the subject of the formula. That is,  the subject of the formula, let us take the square root of both sides. Now, to make r the subject of the formula, let us take the square root of both sides.  denotes the positive square root value, remember that the signs + and denotes the positive square root value, remember that the signs + and Since  to denote the square root. In this – should be written in front of the symbol example, since r represents the radius of the circle, it is positive. Therefore, we can ignore the negative value. However, when the meanings of the unknowns are not known (or have not been given), the correct form is to have both signs. Let us see how l is made the subject of this formula. Let us first keep the term with the square root sign on one side of the equality symbol, and move all the other terms to the other side. symbol, and move all the other terms to the other side. Let us now square both sides.        If the values of all the unknowns in a formula except for one are given, then by substituting these values in the formula, the value of the remaining unknown can be found. Given below is the formula for the volume (v) of a cone, in terms of its radius (r) and its height (h). Find the value of r when v = 132 and h = 14' Let us first make r the subject of the formula. To solve this problem, it is not necessary to first make r the subject of the formula. 58 For free distribution        The known values can be substituted first, and then r can be made the subject. This is done as follows. The same answer is obtained by both methods. Therefore, either of the above two methods can be used to find the value of an unknown term. However, there are many benefits of knowing how to change the subject of a formula. For example, when it is required to find the base radius of several cones of different volumes, if r is made the subject of the above formula for the volume of a cone, then it will be very easy to perform the required calculations to find the different radii. Also, it is necessary to change the subject of the formula if these calculations are being done using a calculator or a computer. 1. Consider the formula  ^i& Find the value of a when v = 10" u = 0 and s = 10. ^ii& Find the value of s when v = 10" u = 5 and a = 2' ^iii& Find the value of u when v = 10" a = 3 and s = 6. 2. If ^i& find the value of x when y = 6 and z = 10. ^ii& find the value of y when x = 5 and z = 5.  ^i& Find the value of t when u = 0" a = 5 and s = 250. ^ii& Find the value of t when u = 5" a = 10 and s = 30.   1. The relationship between the base radius r, the height h and the volume V of a cylinder is given by V = πr2h. If a cylindrical shaped water tank of base radius 50 cm is filled with water to a height of 70 cm, find the volume of water in the 50 cm is filled with water to a height of 70 cm, find the volume of water in the tank. Take 3. The kinetic energy E of an object of mass m travelling with velocity v is given by  The kinetic energy 4. If the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is x, and the lengths of the other two sides are a and b respectively, then according to Pythagoras’ theorem, 5. The energy that a moving object possesses is given by the formula . In this formula, E denotes the energy of the object, m its mass,  v its velocity and h the height of its position.  ^i& Express the mass of the object in terms of the other quantities.  ^ii& Express the velocity of the object in terms of the other quantities. ^iii& The energy possessed by an object of mass 3 kg when it is 5 m above the  ^i& Express the radius of the sphere in terms of the surface area.  ^ii& If the surface area of a sphere is 616 cm2, find its radius. Take the formula ground is 153 N. Find the velocity of this object at this moment. Take g = 10 ms-1'     In earlier grades, you have learned various number patterns. A number pattern when indicated as a list is called a sequence of numbers or simply a sequence. Let us consider the following sequence. In this sequence, the first term is 3, the second term is 8, the third term is 13 etc. A feature of this sequence is that, considering any two consecutive terms in the sequence, when the first term is subtracted from the second term, a constant value is obtained. In this case, the constant value is 5. A similar sequence is shown below. In this sequence too, when the first term is subtracted from the second term, for any pair of consecutive terms, a constant value is obtained. In this case, the constant value is –3. Sequences having this feature are called arithmetic progressions. The constant value obtained by subtracting any term from the term right after that term is called the common difference, and is usually denoted by d. By studying this lesson, you will be able to  recognize arithmetic progressions and solve problems related to arithmetic  progressions. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that a constant value is obtained when any term is subtracted from the term right after that term.   The following notation is used to denote the terms of an arithmetic progression. T1= 1st term T2= 2nd term T3= 3rd term etc. For example, for the arithmetic progression 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,... we may write T1= 6" T2= 8, T3= 10, T4= 12, T5= 14 etc . What is the 25th term of this progression? In other words, what is the value of T25? It is clear that if you continue writing the terms according to the above pattern, the 25th term appears when you write 25 terms. If you do this, you will get 54 as the 25th term. That is, T25 = 54. Now, if you require to find the 500th term of this progression, how would you find it? For this you would have to write down 500 terms following the pattern, which is quite a tedious task. Let us see how we can derive a formula that can be used to find any term of an arithmetic progression rather easily. Let us illustrate this derivation using the above arithmetic progression 6, 8, 10, 12, ... For this progression, the first term is 6 and the common difference is 2. Observe carefully how the terms of this progression have been written in terms of the first term and the common difference in the following table. T1 T2 T3 T4 ...  Value of the term  6  8  10  12  ''' Value of the term in terms of the first term and the common difference  6 = 6 + (1 – 1) × 2  6 + 2 = 6 + (2 – 1) × 2  6 + 2 + 2 = 6 + (3 – 1) × 2  6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 + (4 – 1) × 2  ... ... Now, according to the pattern in the table, T500  = 6 + 499 × 2  = 6 + 998  = 1004 Hence, the 500th term is 1004. Can you generalize the above pattern further? In other words, can you find a formula for the nth term Tn in terms of the first term a and the common difference d? For this, look at the expression T500 = 6 + (500 – 1) × 2 again, where 6 is the 1st term and 2 is the common difference. You can see that if you follow the above pattern to obtain the nth term Tn of the arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d, you obtain Tn = a + (n – 1) d. In this formula, according to our notation, Tn denotes the nth term. Hence, the nth term Tn of the arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d is given by The importance of this formula is that it gives the relationship between the four unknowns a, d, n and Tn. This formula can be used to find the value of any one of the four unknowns when the values of the other 3 unknowns in an arithmetic progression are known. Now let us consider how problems on arithmetic progressions are solved using this formula.  Example 1 (Finding Tn when a, d and n are known) Find the 15th term of the arithmetic progression 3, 7, 11, 15.... Here, a = 3, d = 7 – 3 = 4, n = 15. Substitute these values in Tn = a + (n – 1)d to get  T15 = 3 + (15 – 1) × 4 = 3 + 56 = 59   Example 2 (Finding a when d, n and Tn are known) Find the first term of the arithmetic progression with common difference 4 and 26th term equal to 105. Here, d = 4 and Tn = 105 when n = 26. Substituting these in Tn = a + (n – 1) d we get, T26 = a + (26 – 1) × 4  105 = a + (26 – 1) × 4  105 – 100 = a  a = 5 Therefore the first term is 5.   
Find the common difference of the arithmetic progression with 1st term – 32 and 12th term 1. Here, a = –32 and Tn = 1 when n = 12 Substituting these in  d = 3 Therefore the common difference is 3. Find which term is – 65 in the arithmetic progression 30" 25" 10" ''' Here, a = 30" d = – 5" Tn = – 65 Substituting these in Tn = a + (n – 1) d,  – 65 = 30 × (n – 1) × (– 5)  – 65 = 30 – 5n + 5  – 65 – 35 = –5n 64 For free distribution      For an arithmetic progression, when the values of 2 unknowns out of a, d, n and Tn are not given, the values of these two unknowns can be found by solving two simultaneous equations, when sufficient information has been provided. Example 5 The 7th and 12th terms of an arithmetic progression are 38 and 63 respectively.  (ii) the 20th term. (i) Since Tn = 38 when n = 7 and Tn = 63 when n = 12 , we get, by substituting in  Tn = a + (n – 1) d, T12 = a + (12 – 1) × d 63 = a + 11d T7= a + (7 – 1) × d 38 = a + 6d Now, let us solve 1 and 2 2 – 1 gives  63 – 38 = a + 11d – (a + 6d)  25 = a + 11d – a – 6d  
 
 
 
 
 
 25 = 5d  5 = d  38 – 30 = a  a = 8  progression, let us substitute a = 8, d = 5 and n = 20 in Tn = a + (n – 1) d.  T20 = 8 + (20 – 1) × 5  = 8 + 19 × 5  = 8 + 95  = 103  the 20th term is 103. Example 6 In a certain sequence, the nth term Tn is given by Tn = 3n + 4.  (i) Write down the first 4 terms of this sequence. (ii) Write down an expression for the (n – 1)th term of this sequence and hence  show that this is an arithmetic progression. (iii) Which term is 169 in this arithmetic progression?         When n = 1, T1 = 3 × 1 + 4 = 7 When n = 2, T2 = 3 × 2 + 4 = 10 When n = 3, T3 = 3 × 3 + 4 = 13 When n = 4, T4 = 3 × 4 + 4 = 16   (ii) Replacing n by n – 1 in Tn = 3n + 4, we get  Tn – 1 = 3 (n – 1) + 4  = 3n – 3 + 4  = 3n + 1    = 3 = constant  the sequence is an arithmetic progression. (iii) It is given that Tn = 169.  Substituting in Tn = 3n + 4, we get 169 = 3n + 4  (iv) If there is a term with value 95, then there should be a positive integer n  such that Tn = 95. Then, 95 = 3n + 4 3n = 95 – 4 = 91                                       Exercise 24.1 1.

Consider the arithmetic progression 3" 5" 7" 9" 11" 13" 15" 17" ''' in which the first 8 terms are written down. The sum of these 8 terms is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 80. We denote by Sn the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression. In this notation, the sum of the first 8 terms of the above arithmetic progression can be written as S8 = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 S8 = 80 5. Find the  (i) first three terms  (ii) common difference  (iii) 15th term for each of the arithmetic progressions with nth term given by  (i) 2n + 1 (ii) 5n – 1 (iii) 8 – n (iv) 20 – 5n 6.

Find the first term, the common difference and the 21st term of this progression.  (vi) Which term is 52 more than the 7th term of the arithmetic progression  3, 7, 11, ...  When we have to find the sum of a large number of terms, this lengthy way of adding all the terms one by one is a tedious task. In order to overcome this problem, let us derive a formula that can be used to find the sum of the initial terms of an arithmetic progression. Considering the above example, we rewrite S8 = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 and again by reversing the terms we write S8 = 17 + 15 + 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 Now from 1 and 2 we may write, rearranging the terms,  2 S8 = (3 + 17) + (5 + 15) + (7 + 13) + (9 + 11) + (11 + 9) + (13 + 7) + (15 + 5)  + (17 + 3)  2 S8 = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20  2 S8 = 8 × 20 (there are 8 terms of 20)   = 80 We may illustrate the above method as follows. There are 8 terms in the progression. The first term and the last term add to 20. The second and the penultimate term add to 20. Continuing this, we see that the sum of the first 8 terms of the progression is a sum of 4 pairs. The number of such pairs is one half the total number of terms to be added. Then the sum of all the terms is the product, Now, let us derive a formula using the above process, for the sum of the first n terms, Sn, of an arithmetic progression with first term a, common difference d and last (nth) term l. We may write, 20 20 20 20     Sn = a + ( a + d ) + ( a + 2d ) + ( a + 3d ) + ... ( l – 2d ) + ( l – d ) + l and then reversing the terms, Sn = l + ( l – d ) + ( l – 2d ) + ( l – 3d ) + ... ( a + 2d ) + ( a + d ) + a Now 1 and 2 gives  2 Sn = ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ... ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) As an example, let us find using the above formula, the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. The relevant progression is 1" 2" 3" 4" '''98" 99" 100, where a = 1, l = 100 and n = 100. The above formula can be used to find the sum of an arithmetic progression given the first term (a), the number of terms (n) and the last term (l). Now we derive a formula for the sum, given the first term (a), the number of terms (n) and the common difference (d). we substitute for l, which is actually Tn, the nth term given by Tn = a + (n – 1) d. we then get, Therefore, to find the sum Sn of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d, use the formula                      As an example, let us find the sum of the first 30 terms of the arithmetic progression 2, 4, 6, 8, ... In this progression, a = 2 d = 2 and n = 30.  Example 2 An arithmetic progression has 16 terms. The first term and the last term are 75 and 0 respectively. Find its sum if the common difference is – 5. Here a = 70, l = 2, and d = – 4. First we have to find the number of terms in the progression. Using the formula . the sum of the terms of the series is 648  is in 4 unknowns, namely Sn, n, a and l. Whenever three of these unknowns are given, the remaining unknown can be found by using the formula. The case for the formula The first term, the last term and the sum of all the terms of an arithmetic progression are 12, 99 and 1665 respectively. Find the number of terms, the common difference and the sum of the first 15 terms. Finally, in order to find the sum of the first 15 terms, substitute n = 15, a = 12, d = 3 in   How many terms (starting from the 1st term) of the arithmetic progression 13, 11, 9, ..., add to 40? Substitute a = 13, d = –2 , Sn = 40. Note( Here there are two acceptable solutions for n. Sum of the first four terms when n is 4 = 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 = 40 Sum of the first ten terms when n is 10 or or Here, both values are acceptable. Therefore 4 or 10 terms can be taken for the sum to be 40.  (i) a = 2, l = 62 and n = 31  (ii) a = 95, l = 10 and n = 12  , d =  (iii) a = 2.

Solve each of the following inequalities and write down the set of integral  solutions of the inequality.

Nimal who placed a 1 kg standard weight in one pan of a balance scale, placed a 500 g standard weight and three cakes of soap of the same type on the other pan. He observed that the pan with the 1 kg standard weight dipped below the other pan. If the mass of a cake of soap is taken as p grammes, an inequality p in terms of p can be written. Find the maximum integral value that the mass of a cake of soap can be.      2 –3 –1 –2 ² Therefor the region to the right of the straight line L is named x >3. ² The x coordinate of any point that belongs to the region x >3 is greater than 3. ² Therefore the region to the left of the straight line L is named x < 3. ² The x coordinate of any point that belongs to the region x < 3 is less than 3. It is clear that the Cartesian plane illustrated in the above example is divided into three specific regions, namely x < 3, x = 3 and x >3 by the straight line x = 3. Now let us see how these regions are represented in a Cartesian plane.  The region x < 3    The straight line x = 3 is indicated by a dashed line. This means that the points such that x = 3 do not belong to the region x < 3. The line x = 3 has been indicated by a thick line. This means that both the regions x < 3 and x = 3 belong to the shaded region. Therefore this region is named x ≤ 3.      A few more examples to illustrat the regions on a Cartesian plane separated by a line parallel to the x axis are given below.  y > 2   Exercise 25.2 1.

(i) y > x       What is meant by indicating y = x by a dashed line is that the points satisfying y = x do not belong to the shaded region y > x. What is meant by indicating y = x by a thick line is that the points satisfying y = x belong to the shaded region y ≥ x.                            2. Which of the following points belong to the region  A = (5, 5) B= (–3, –2) C = (0, –1) Data collected through a survey on the number of family members that reside in each of the houses in a certain housing scheme is given below.  4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6, 3 8, 4, 5, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5, 4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 5, 7 5, 5, 7, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 4, 5, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4 The greatest value of this data set is 9 and the least value is 2. The value that is obtained when the least value is subtracted from the greatest value is defined as the range. When the range of a data set is small, as in the above case, the information related to the data can be tabulated as follows. A table of the following form is called a frequency distribution. Number of family members residing in the house Frequency (Number of families) 12 14 Information on the marks obtained for mathematics at the term test by the grade 10 students of a certain school is given below.             25" 12" 65" 40" 32" 84" 52" 65" 32" 09 70" 53" 67" 56" 65" 48" 20" 17" 08" 43 52" 68" 73" 25" 39" 42" 61" 22" 37" 45 36" 65" 24" 53" 46" 18" 39" 54" 26" 35 27" 94" 59" 87" 72 In this case, the greatest value is 94 while the least value is 8. Accordingly, the range of the data set = 94 – 8  = 86 Since the range of this data set is large, if we tabulate this information under each value from 8 to 94, we will obtain a very long table.      When the range of the data set is large, as in the above case, it is convenient to divide the data into groups and tabulate the information. A frequency distribution prepared by separating the above data into class intervals is given below.  8 - 16 17 - 25 26 - 34 35 - 43 44 - 52 53 - 61 62 - 70 71 - 79 80 - 88 89 - 97 What is meant by stating that the frequency of the class interval 8 - 16 is 3, is that there are 3 values (data) that lie in the interval from 8 to 16. The greatest frequency of this distribution is 8. It corresponds to the class interval 35 - 43. This class interval is named the modal class. A frequency distribution such as the above which is expressed using class intervals is called a grouped frequency distribution. When preparing a grouped frequency distribution, the class intervals are formed so that there are about 10 class intervals. Observe that all the class intervals in this example are of the same size.That is, the size of each class interval is 9.           The initial class interval of this distribution is 8 - 16, and the next class interval is 17 -25. The relevant data are test marks. Since there are no marks between 16 and 17, the class intervals have been organized such that when the first class interval ends with 16, the next class interval starts with 17. Now let us consider how the mean of a grouped frequency distribution such as the above distribution is found. For this, the mid-value of each class interval has to be found first. Accordingly, the mid-value of the class interval 8 – 16 is 12. The mid-value of a class interval is found by adding together the upper value and the lower value of the class interval and then dividing this sum by 2. The mid-value of every class interval can be found in this manner. The mid-value of a class interval is considered as the representative value of the data in that class interval when calculations are performed. 8 - 16 17 - 25 26 - 34 35 - 43 44 - 52 53 - 61 62 - 70 71 - 79 80 - 88 89 - 97 12 21 30 39 48 57 66 75 84 93 A grouped frequency distribution prepared with the data collected on the ages of the staff members in a certain office is given below. Age of the staff member (Years) Number of staff members Let us recall how the class intervals were written in the example discussed earlier on the mathematics marks of the grade 10 students. The first class interval was writ- ten as 8 – 16 and the second class interval was written as 17 – 25. Since there were no marks between 16 and 17, it was appropriate to separate the class intervals in this manner. However in this example, the first class interval is written as 20 – 25, and the second class interval is written as 25 – 30. That is, the second class interval starts with the same value that the first class interval ends. The reason for this is because the data collected here are the ages of people. Since there can be people whose ages lies between 25 and 26 years, the second class interval should com- mence with the value with which the previous class interval ended. The ages 20 or greater but less than 25 belong to the class interval 20 – 25. Accordingly the age 25 years belongs to the class interval 25 – 30 years. Data such as length, weight, etc,. Which can take any value within a range are called continuous data. Data such as no.of students, marks, etc,. Which take only integral values are called discrete data. Given below is the grouped frequency distribution of the ages of the staff members, together with the mid-values of the class intervals. 22.5 27.5 32.5 37.5 42.5 47.5 52.5 57.5 20 - 25 25 - 30 30 - 35 35 - 40 40 - 45 45 - 50 50 - 55 55 - 60 11 - 20 21 - 30 31 - 40 41 - 50 51 - 60 61 - 70 71 - 80 81 - 90 91 - 100  (i) Complete the mid-value column.

(ii) By using the table, find the number of children in the class whose heights are When calculating the mean of grouped data, the mid-value of a class interval is taken as the value which represents the whole class interval. Let us now consider how the mean of grouped data is calculated using the mid-values. number of students who were present in a certain school during the first term is given below. Class Interval (Number who were present)  Frequency (Number of days) 531 - 550 551 - 570 571 - 590 591 - 610 611 - 630 4 10 21 12 10  (i) Copy the table and complete the mid-value column.

(ii) How many bulbs burned out in less than 400 hours?  (iii) How many bulbs were used to conduct this test?  (Assume that the number of hours each bulb that was used remained lit was  between 100 hours and 700 hours)  The following grouped frequency distribution gives the marks that 40 students received out of 25 on a mathematics test. Class Interval (Marks) By using the above information, let us construct a table which contains a mid-value column and a column consisting of the product of the mid-values and the corresponding frequencies. Here x denotes the mid-value and f denotes the frequency. 18 70 210 198 88 Frequency  f 15 11 4 04 - 08 08 - 12 12 - 16 16 - 20 20 - 24 x 6 10 14 18 22 Here, Σf denotes the total number of children, fx denotes the product of the mid-value x and the relevant frequency f, and Σfx denotes the sum of the values in the fx column.Then the mean is defined by That is,      1. A frequency distribution prepared using the data on the quantity of beans that was brought to a certain vegetable collection centre on a certain day by 40 farmers is given below. This information was obtained through a survey conducted on the quantities of vegetables that are brought to the vegetable collection centre by farmers.  (i) Calculate the mean quantity of beans that was brought by the farmers.  (ii) Accordingly, what is the quantity of beans that can be expected to be brought  (i) What is the size of a class interval?  (ii) What is the modal class?  (iii) Find the mean mark obtained by a student in the class.  The class intervals of a grouped frequency distribution may sometimes contain large mid-values. In such situations, finding the mean using the above method may not be easy. Let us consider a more suitable method of finding the mean of a distribution of this type, through an example. That is, by considering a simple example, let us explain how the mean is calculated using the assumed mean. Example 1 The following table contains data on the number of units of water that was consumed during a month by 70 families who receive water from a certain water scheme. Class interval Number of families  Age (Years)  (i) How many teachers are serving in this educational division? (ii) To which age group does the most number of teachers belong? (iii) Calculate the mean age of a teacher serving in this educational division based  Circumference of a tree trunk (cm) Frequency  (i) Find the modal class of this distribution.  (ii) Using the above information, calculate the mean circumference of a tree trunk Calculate the mean number of water units that was consumed by a family, to the nearest whole number. Let us first find the mid-values which represent each of the class intervals. Let us now assume that the mid-value 22 of the class interval 21 – 23 is the mean. That is, let us take 22 to be the assumed mean. Now let us find the deviation of each mid-value from the assumed mean by subtracting the assumed mean from each mid-value. 1 26 11 8 Deviation d Frequency  f 12 - 14 15 - 17 18 - 20 21 - 23 24 - 26 27 - 29 13 16 19 22 25 28 Here Σf denotes the total number of families, fd the product of the deviation and the corresponding frequency, and Σfd the sum of the values in the fd column. It is easy to find the deviations by taking the assumed mean to be either the mid-value of the modal class or the mid-value of the median class.    If the assumed mean is denoted by A and the deviations are denoted by d, then the mean of the frequency distribution is given by A  Number of viewers  (i) What is the modal class of the above frequency distribution?

(iii) If this pattern of sales is expected to continue during the next two months too, estimate the amount of rice that should be stored to be sufficient for the next 60 days.

(iii) When the number of electricity units used lies in the interval 61 – 90, the Electricity Board charges Rs.14 per unit. Accordingly, what is the income that the Electricity Board can expect to earn from these 100 households during that month? 7. Information on the monthly telephone bills of the customers of a certain private telephone company, obtained by conducting a survey in a particular region is given below. Monthly telephone bill (Rs.)

The following table contains information on the speed of the vehicles that passed a certain location during a period of two hours.

(iii) Find the mean speed of a vehicle which passes this location by taking the A straight line segment drawn from the centre of a circle to a point on the circle is called a radius (Observe the above figure). The length of this line segment is the same irrespective of the point on the circumference that is selected. Therefore, such a line segment is called the radius of the circle. The length of the radius is also called the radius. A chord which passes through the centre of the circle is called a diameter. All the diameters of a circle are equal in length. This length is also called the diameter. A diameter is the longest chord of a circle. The length of a diameter is twice the length of the radius. • On a piece of paper, construct a circle of radius 3 cm using a pair of compasses and name its centre as O. Draw a chord AB which is not a diameter of the circle. • By measuring the length using a ruler, mark the midpoint of the chord as C and • solve problems by using the theorem that the straight line joining the midpoint of a chord of a circle to the centre is perpendicular to the chord, and       Discuss what you learnt through this activity with the other students in the class. The relationship that was identified is a theorem related to the chords of a circle. AB is a chord of a circle with centre O and radius 5 cm. The midpoint of AB is C. If AB = 8 cm, find the length of OC. Let us represent this information in a figure.  with the aid of a protractor. Observe that this angle is 90o, that is, that OC and AB are perpendicular to each other. • Draw several more chords of different lengths within this circle itself and observe that the straight line joining the midpoint of each chord to the centre is perpendicular to the respective chord.   Theorem The straight line joining the centre of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.       (Since the straight line joining the centre of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord) . .. OCB is a right angled triangle. Let us find the length of OC by applying Pythagoras’ theorem. Also  OB2 = OC2 + CB2 (Pythagoras’ theorem) (Since the straight line joining the centre of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord)    2. PQ is a chord of a circle with centre O. The midpoint of the chord is R. If PQ=12 cm and OR = 8 cm, find the radius of the circle. 3. AB and BC are two chords of a circle with centre O which are perpendicular to each other. AB = 12 cm and BC = 8 cm. The mid-points of AB and BC are X and Y respectively. Find the perimeter of the quadrilateral OXBY. O x x O x O     27.2 The formal proof of the theorem that “the straight line joining the midpoint of a chord of a circle to the centre is perpendicular to the chord” To be proved: OX is perpendicular to AB. Construction: Join OA, OB.  Proof : In the triangles OXA and OXB,  AO = BO (Radii of the same circle)  AX = XB (Since X is the midpoint of AB)  OX is a common side. AB and BC are two chords of a circle with centre O which are perpendicular to each other. The mid-points of AB and BC are X and Y respectively. If AB = 8 cm and BC = 6 cm, find the perimeter of the quadrilateral BXOY. 5. The vertices P, Q and R of the triangle PQR lie on a circle with centre O. The midpoints of PQ and QR are A and B respectively. If PQ = 16 cm, OA = 6 cm and calculate the length of QR.          AB and CD are two equal chords of a circle of centre O. The midpoints of AB and CD are X and Y respectively. Show that OX = OY. To show that OX = OY, let us first show that the two triangles OXB and OYC are congruent to each other under the conditions of hypotenuse-side. In the triangles OXB and OYC, since X is the midpoint of AB and Y is the midpoint of CD, Therefore, since X and Y are the midpoints of the chords AB and CD, we obtain XB = YC.  S is the midpoint of the chord PQ of the circle with centre O. OS produced meets the circle at R. If RS = SO, show that OPRQ is a rhombus.  PS = SQ (Since S is the midpoint of the chord PQ)  RS = SO      P 4.  R is the midpoint of the chord PQ of the circle with centre O. If B AB is a chord of the circle with centre O. Its midpoint is C. When OC is produced it meets the circle at D. Show that AD = DB. The vertices A,B and C of the triangle ABC lie on a circle with centre O. The midpoint of BC is X. If O lies on AX, show that AB = AC.

AB and CD are two chords of a circle with centre O. The midpoints of AB and CD are P and Q respectively. The chords AB and DC produced meet at M. Show that are supplementary angles.  The theorem studied above states that the straight line joining the midpoint of a chord of a circle to the centre is perpendicular to the chord. The converse of this theorem is also true. It is expressed as a theorem as follows. Theorem: The perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. Now let us consider a couple of examples of calculations done using the theorem that “the perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord”. AB and BC are two equal chords of a circle with centre O. The perpendiculars drawn from O to the two chords are OX , then find the and OY respectively. If magnitude of Since OX X is the midpoint of AB and Y is the midpoint of BC. '  AB and OY   Also, since it has been given that AB = BC, we obtain that XB = YB. Therefore, BXY is an isosceles triangle. The midpoints of the chords AB and BC of the circle with centre O are P and Q respectively. Show that PQ and RS are two equal chords of a circle with centre O. The midpoints of PQ and RS are X and Y respectively. Show that         OR is the perpendicular drawn from a circle with centre O to the chord PQ. If OR= 3 cm and PQ = 8 cm, find the radius of the circle. Since OR ABC is an equilateral triangle. The vertices A,B and C lie on the circle with centre O. The perpendicular drawn from O to BC is OX. If XB = 6 cm, find the perimeter of the triangle ABC. PQ is a chord of a circle with centre O. The perpendicular drawn from O to PQ is OR. If PQ = 12 cm and OR = 8 cm, find the perimeter of the triangle OPQ.       AB and BC are two equal chords of a circle with centre O. The perpendiculars drawn from O to the two chords are OX and OY respectively. Prove that OX = OY. We will prove that OX = OY by showing that the right triangles OXB and OYB are congruent under the conditions of hypotenuse-side. OB is the common side of these two triangles. 110  PQ is a chord of a circle with centre O. The perpendicular drawn from O to PQ is OX.

If PQ = 16 cm and SR = 12 cm, find the distance between the two chords. PQ and RS are two parallel chords of the circle with centre O as shown in the figure. The radius of the circle is 10 cm. If PQ = 12 cm and SR = 16 cm, find the distance between the two chords. 27.4 Proving riders using the theorem that “the perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord”    Since AB=BC, by the above theorem we have that BX = YB.  (Hypotenuse-side)  (The remaining elements of congruent triangels are equal to each other.) Exercise 27.4 4. B  PQ and RS are two chords of a circle with centre O. The perpendiculars drawn from O to PQ and RS are OX and OY respectively. If OX = OY prove that PQ = RS.    The vertices A, B and C of the triangle ABC lie on the circle with centre O. The perpendiculars drawn from O to AB and BC are OX and OY respectively. If AX = CY, ' then prove that  AB and BC are two equal chords of a circle with centre O which are perpendicular to each other. Prove that OXBY is a square. AB and AC are two chords of a circle with centre O. The perpendicular drawn from O to AC is OQ. If 2 AB = AC, prove that AB = AQ.

PQ and RS are two chords of a circle with centre O. The perpendiculars drawn from O to PQ and RS are OX and OY respectively. Show that The path of a point in motion is defined as its locus. Several examples of loci that can be observed in our environment are given below. 1. The path of a fruit which falls from a tree. 2. The path of the pointed end of a clock hand. 3. The path of a planet orbiting around the sun. 4. The path of a pendulum in a pendulum clock. 5. The path of a ball that is hit by a bat. In this lesson we will only be considering loci in a plane. Note: Before considering the construction of loci, direct your attention to the following facts. 1. Distance between two points: Let us consider two points A and B that lie on a plane. What is meant by the distance between the two points is the length of the straight line segment joining the two points. 2. Distance from a point to a straight line: Let us consider a given point A and a given straight line. What is meant by the distance from A to the straight line is the shortest distance from A to the straight line. This shortest distance is the perpendicular distance from A to the straight line. By studying this lesson you will be able to • construct the four basic loci • construct parallel lines • construct triangles with the given information.       3. Distance between two parallel lines Consider the following two parallel lines. Let us consider any point A on one of the lines. The perpendicular distance from A to the other straight line is said to be the distance between the two lines. Since the two lines are parallel, irrespective of where the point A is located on the line, this distance remains the same. The pointed end of each hand on the clock face in the figure is always located at a constant distance from the centre of the clock, which is the location at which the hand is fixed to the clock. You will be able to observe when the clock is working, that the path of the pointed end of each hand is a circle. The point where the hands are fixed to the clock is the centre of these circles, and the radius of each circle is the length of the relevant hand. Observe here that the pointed end of each hand is travelling at a constant distance from a fixed point. That particular constant distance is the length of the hand. 10 9 8 Let us see how a circle is constructed. Mark a point. Take the radius of the circle that you want to construct to the pair of compasses using the ruler and keep the point of the pair of compasses on the point you marked. Now draw the circle. 2. Constructing the locus of a point moving at an equal distance from two fixed As shown in the figure, the point P is at an equal distance from the two points A and B. Further, Q is another point which is at an equal distance from A and B. There are a large number of points such as these, which are at an equal distance from A and B. Observe what is obtained when all these points are joined together.    It is clear that the straight line that is obtained when all these points are joined together, passes through the midpoint of the line joining A and B, and is perpendicular to AB. Now let us consider how this locus, that is, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB is constructed. Mark two points and name them as A and B. Step 1: Draw the line segment AB. On the pair of compasses, take a length which is a little more than half the length of AB, and taking A and B as the centres and the length on the pair of compasses as the radius, draw two arcs which intersect each other (as shown in the figure). Step 2: Name the intersection points of the two arcs as C and D and draw the straight line which passes through these two points. This straight line is the required locus. A The figure illustrates a pair of straight lines drawn parallel to the straight line AB on opposite sides of AB. Each of these lines is at a constant distance of 2 cm from AB. Conversely, if a point lies at a distance of 2 cm from AB, then it is clear that this point must lie on one of the above two lines. Q 116 For free distribution The locus of a point moving at an equal distance from two fixed points is the perpendicular bisector of the straight line joining the two points.                                                                           Accordingly, the locus of a point which lies 2 cm from the straight line AB is one of two straight lines which are parallel to AB and lie on opposite sides of AB 2 cm from it. Now let us consider how a pair of lines parallel to a given straight line, which is the locus under consideration, is constructed.  A Draw a straight line segment using a straight edge. Select two points A and B on this straight line. Step 2: On each of these two perpendicular lines, mark two points at the required distance (say 5 cm), on either side of the given straight line, and name them P, Q, R and S as shown in the figure.  Step 3: Draw the straight lines PQ and RS. These two straight lines are the required locus.  The locus of a point moving at a constant distance from a given straight line is a line parallel to the given straight line, at the given constant distance from the straight line, which may lie on either side of the straight line.                                                                                   The straight lines AB and CD in the figure intersect at O. The straight line PQ has been drawn such that ) is the angle divided into two equal angles. The line PQ is called the bisector of the angle ). Similarly, the straight line RS has been drawn such that the angle (and the angle Can you see that the distance from any point on the line PQ to the lines AB and CD is equal? Understand that similarly, the distance from any point on the line RS to the lines AB and CD is also equal. Do you see that conversely, if a point is at an equal distance from the lines AB and CD, then it must lie on either PQ or RS? Let the two straight lines AB and CD intersect at the point O. Step 1: Using the pair of compasses, draw an arc with centre O such that it intersects both BA and DC.

B For free distribution    Method 3 Let us assume that the straight line is AB and the external point is C. Step 2: Draw another arc with centre P and the same radius as that of the previous arc (i.e., keeping the radius CP unchanged), such that it intersects AB. Name the intersection point as Q. Step 4: Now draw another arc with centre C and the same radius as before, such that it intersects the arc in step 3. Name the intersection point of the arcs as R. Do the following activity to further understand about constructions related to parallel lines. 1. Construct an angle of 60o and name the vertex as A.

The cross sections of the solids given above are uniform, and the plane surfaces at the two ends are parallel to each other. Solids having such shapes are defined in general as cylinders. Circular plane surfaces The cylinder in the figure has two circular plane surfaces at the top and the bottom. Apart from these, it also has a curved surface. The radii of the two circular plane surfaces are equal to each other. Therefore, the areas of these two plane surfaces are equal. The straight line joining the centres of these two circles is called the axis of the cylinder. Any straight line on the curved surface which is parallel to the axis of the cylinder is called a generator of the cylinder. The axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the two circular plane surfaces. Therefore, such a cylinder is called a right circular cylinder. (There are cylinders which are not right circular. However such cylinders will not be discussed here.) What is meant by the term “right” is that the axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the two plane surfaces. What is meant by the term “circular” is that any cross section which is perpendicular to the axis is circular in shape. The radius of a plane face of the cylinder is usually denoted by r and the length of the axis is usually denoted by h. The radius r of the circular faces is called the radius of the cylinder and the length of the axis h is called the height of the cylinder. 128 For free distribution By studying this lesson you will be able to  • calculate the surface area and volume of a right circular cylinder  • calculate the surface area and volume of a right triangular prism  When the radius and the height of a cylinder are given, the areas of the three surface parts of the cylinder need to be added together to obtain the total surface area. The areas of the two circular faces at the two ends can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle. A mechanism such as the following can be used to calculate the area of the curved surface When the curved surface of the cylinder is cut along a generator as shown in the figure and opened out, a rectangle is obtained. The length of one side of this rectangle is equal to the height (h) of the cylinder while the length of the other side is equal to the perimeter of one of its circular plane faces. The area of this rectangle is equal to the area of the curved surface of the cylinder. Accordingly, an expression for the curved surface of the cylinder can be developed in the following manner. Now we can find the total surface area of the cylinder in the following manner. Area of curved Total surface area surface of the cylinder Area of top + face   Area of bottom face      Note: (i) Exterior surface area of a cylinder without a lid = πr2 + 2 πrh (ii) Exterior surface area of a cylinder without a base or a lid = 2 πrh Let us now consider several solved problems related to the surface area of a cylinder.

The properties given below are common to the solids illustrated in the above figure. ² The cross section is uniform. ² The cross section takes the shape of a polygon. ² The side faces are rectangles. ² The faces at the two ends are perpendicular to the side faces. Solids with these properties are called right prisms. From these right prisms, we will pay further attention to the one with a triangular cross section. The figure illustrates a right prism with a triangular cross section. Here, ^1& ABC and PQR represent the two triangular faces at the two ends of the prism. ^2& the three rectangular side faces are represented by BQRC, CRPA and APQB  (These faces are also called lateral faces). ^3& The distance between the two triangular faces is named the length or the height 7.

Let us consider how the volume of a prism with a triangular cross section which you identified in 28.2 above is found. Cross sectional area We know that the volume of a right solid with a uniform cross section is equal to the product of the area of the cross section and the height (length). We can use the above principle to find the volume of the right prism with a uniform triangular cross section given in the figure. hen, Volume of the prism Area of the cross section Note: When the area A of the triangular cross section is not given directly, it is necessary to calculate it using the data related to the triangular cross section given in the problem.

A vessel, the shape of the prism in the figure is completely filled with water. All the water in this vessel is poured into a vessel the shape of a right cylinder of radius 7 cm. To what height does the water level rise in the cylinder?             We know that we will get either heads or tails when we toss a coin. This observation is an example of a random experiment. The possible results are either 'heads' or 'tails'. However we cannot say with certainty what the outcome will be before observing it. Experiments in which we know the possible outcomes, but cannot say with certainty which outcome will occur are called random experiments. The set to which all the possible outcomes of a random experiment belong is called 'the sample space'. It is denoted by S. The following table shows some examples for random experiments and the relevant sample spaces. Consider the random experiment of rolling a fair tetrahedronal die numbered from 1 to 4 and recording the result. The sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Some subsets of this sample space are {3}, {2, 4}, {1, 2, 3}. These subsets can be explained as follows: {3} denotes ''The event of getting 3 as the result". {2, 4} denotes "The event of getting 2 or 4 as the result". • identify simple events and composite events • find the probability of events which are not mutually exclusive • find the probability of an event using a grid or a tree diagram    Also if "getting a number less than 4" is denoted by A, then it can be written as A = {1, 2, 3}. the sample space is S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6}. Let us write some events relevant to the sample space. {1}, {2}, {3}, {1" 3}, {2" 4}, {1" 3" 5}, {2" 3" 5}, {3" 4" 5" 6} In the above events, {1}, {2} and {3} consist of only one outcome each. Such events are called simple events. Thus, {5}, {6} are simple events. Events which are not simple are called composite events. The events {1" 3}, {2" 4}, {1" 3" 5} are composite events. These composite events can be further decomposed into subsets. Because the coin is unbiased, it is clear that the likelihood of getting either of these two outcomes is equal. Let us consider another example. There are 3 identical balls in a bag coloured red, white and black. Consider taking out one ball at random. The sample space is shown below. Because the balls are identical, it is clear that the likelihood of taking any one of the balls is equal. If each of the outcomes in a random experiment has an equal likelihood of occuring, that experiment is called an experiment with equally likely outcomes. 144 For free distribution    Consider the experiment of "tossing an unbiased coin." As you have learnt in earlies grades, the probability of each equally likely outcome "getting heads" and "getting tails" in the sample space is Now let us consider a random experiment which is not an experiment with equally likely outcomes. Amara planted a mango seed and observed whether a plant would grow within a week. The sample space is In an instance where all the outcomes of a sample space are equally likely to occur, the probability of an event occuring is defined as below. Let us denote the number of elements in the sample space S by n (S) and the number of elements in the event A by n (A). The probability of A occuring is denoted by P(A). Then With reference to an experiment in which a card is drawn randomly from a bag containing 5 identical cards numbered from 1 to 5,  (i) write the sample space and find n(S).  (ii) write the elements of A and find n(A) if A is the event of getting an even  number  (iii) find the probability P(A) that an even number is drawn.  (i) S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5}. . .. n (S) = 5  (ii) A = {2" 4}. . .. n (A) = 2 Here there are no reasons to assume that the outcomes are equally likely. Here, taking the probability of a plant growing as Probability of the event occuring Number of elements in the event Number of elements in the sample space      In an experiment of rolling an unbiased die with its faces marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  (i) find the probability that the number shown is 4.  (ii) find the probability that the number shown is odd. (iii) find the probability that the number is greater than 2. The sample space is S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6}. Thus n(S) = 6. Since there are three (1, 3 and 5) odd numbers, the probability of getting an odd number Since there are four (3, 4, 5 and 6) numbers greater than 2, the probability of getting a number greater than  (b) Write 5 simple events in the event A. 146 For free distribution 1. Write down the sample space for each of the following random experiments.  (i) Recording the card drawn from a pack of 10 identical cards numbered 1 to 10. (ii) A circular disk is divided into three identical sectors, one of which is coloured red, another blue and the other yellow. A pointer is fixed to the center of the disk and the disk is spun. The colour of the sector at which it stops is recorded. (iii) Recording the number of runs scored by a batsman in a single delivery in a 2. Determine whether each event given below is a simple or a composite event.  (i) When rolling a tetrahedronal die numbered 1 to 4,  (a) getting the number 3  (ii) In a pack of 5 identical cards labelled A, B, C, D and E,  (a) drawing the card labelled A 3.When randomly taking a card from a bag containing 8 identical cards numbered  1 to 8,  (a) if the event of getting a card with a number greater than 4 is A, then write If A and B are two events, then their intersection also events. For example, suppose there are 5 identical balls numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and one is picked at random. Then, If we denote the event of picking a ball with a number greater than 2 as A, A = {3, 4, 5}' If we denote the event of picking an even numbered ball as B, B = {2" 4}' Then, sets A and B; that is, a ball with an even number greater than 2. Furthermore,  denotes the event of picking a ball  = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Here, in either set A or in set B; that is, a ball with either an even number or a number greater than 2.  (i) Write the sample space.  (ii) If the event of drawing a square number is X, then write the elements of X randomly.  (i) Write the sample space.  (ii) Find the probability of drawing a red bead.  (iii) Find the probability of drawing a blue bead. Brand A Brand B Mango Flavoured 2 3 Orange Flavoured 1 2  (i) an orange flavoured toffee  (iii) a toffee of brand B  (v) an orange flavoured toffee of brand B   (ii) a toffee of brand A  (iv) a mango flavoured toffee of brand A  Now let us consider a relationship between the events A, B, A and B are any two events in a sample space with equally likely outcomes. Since the outcomes are equally likely, Thus, for any two events A and B in a sample space with equally likely outcomes, we have      A fair tetrahedronal die with its sides numbered from 1 to 4 is rolled. Let us denote the event that it rests on an even numbered face by A and the event that it rests on an odd numbered face by B. That is, A = {2, 4} and B = {1, 3}. Then O. This means that A and B have no common elements. That is, these two events do not occur together. Such events are said to be mutually exclusive events. Now, let us find given information in a Venn diagram. There is a pack of 5 identical cards numbered from 1 to 5. Consider the random experiment of drawing a card randomly. The sample space here is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. If A is the event of drawing an even numbered card, then A = {2, 4}.    If the event of A not happening, that is, the event of not drawing an even numbered card is B, then, B = {1, 3, 5}. In the above experiment, if the event of drawing an even numbered card is A, then the event of drawing a card which is not even numbered is the complement of A. The complement of A is written as A . Therefore A = {1, 3, 5}. Therefore, These results are true for any event.  1. In a random experiment of rolling a fair die numbered from 1 to 6, let  A be the event that a prime number is obtained,  B be the event that a perfect square is obtained,  C be the event that a number greater than 4 is obtained and  D be the event that a multiple of 6 is obtained.  Select all pairs of mutually exclusive events.        Consider a random experiment of tossing two unbiased identical coins A and B simultaneously. Let us denote the heads by H and the tails by T. The set of all possible outcomes of this experiment can be listed as follows: Getting heads in both coins, (H, H) Getting heads in coin A and tails in coin B, (H, T) Getting tails in coin A and heads in coin B, (T, H) Getting tails in both coins, (T, T) Accordingly, the sample space can be written as {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}. This sample space can be represented in a grid as follows: T  coin A The sample space of this experiment consists of four outcomes. Since the coins are unbiased and identical, all the possible outcomes are equally likely and thus the following probabilities are obtained:  (i) Find  (ii) There by show that X and Y are mutually exclusive.     Note: In the above random experiment all the outcomes were equally likely. Even though it is not compulsory to represent the outcomes in a grid, finding the probability by this method is not possible when the outcomes are not equally likely. Let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin and rolling a tetrahedronal die numbered from 1 to 4, and recording the faces touching the table. (i) Show the sample space as a set of ordered pairs on a grid and then represent it (a) 1 on the die. (b) an even number on the die and tails on the coin. (c) 2 on the die and heads on the coin.  (a) In the above grid, the area marked by are the elements of the event of getting 1 on the die. There are 2 elements there. The total number of elements in the sample space is 8. ∴ 2 1 The probability of getting 1 on the die = 8 4= an even number on the die and tails on the coin. There are 2 such elements. ∴ 1 4= 2 8 2  tetrahedronal die getting two on the die and heads on the coin. There is one such element.

A ball is taken from the bag randomly and the number is recorded. Then the ball is put back in the bag (with replacement) and again a ball is randomly taken for a second time and this number is also recorded. 3  1st ball       1.

(i) Entering from A and exiting from B.  (ii) Entering from A or B and exiting from D.  (iii) Entering from E  (iv) Entering and exiting from different roads.  Consider the following random experiments.  (i) Two unbiased coins are tossed simultaneously and the sides shown are recorded. It is clear that whatever the result of one coin toss is, it will not affect the result of the other. (ii) There are two bags containing some identical balls. One ball is taken randomly  from each bag. It is clear that the ball taken from one bag will not affect what  ball is taken from the other bag. (iii) During the germination of a few planted seeds, germination of one seed does  not have an impact on the germination of the other seeds. In this way, if one event does not affect another, the two events are called independent. The independence of two events is defined as follows. We have learnt that two mutually exclusive events are two events that do not occur together. But what is meant by 2 events being independent is that the occurrance of one event does not affect the occurrance of the other event. 5. A plant has 4 red flowers and 3 yellow flowers of identical shape and size. 2 butterflies, A and B, come to the flowers to drink nectar.

(Assume that the butterflies pick flowers randomly.)  (i) Butterfly A picking a red flower and butterfly B picking a yellow flower.  (ii) Both butterflies picking flowers of the same colour.  (iii) Both butterflies picking flowers of different colours.  (iv) Both butterflies picking the same flower.

Let us denote the event of candidate A passing as A and candidate B passing as B.  (i) The probability of both candidates A and B passing is Because they are independent events,   Take the event of the first coin being heads as A. Take the event of both the coins showing the same side as B. Two unbiased identical coins are tossed simultaneously. Let us represent the sample space of this random experiment in a grid.

An unbiased coin is tossed twice and in each case the outcomes is recorded. Draw the relevant tree diagram and find the probabilities of the following events.  (i) Getting heads both times.  (ii) Getting the same side both times.  (iii) Getting tails at least once.  (vi) Getting heads the second time. This experiment can be separated into two. That is, the first toss and the second toss. The two outcomes of the first toss can be represented in a tree diagram with two branches as shown below. probabilities are the tree diagram as given below. T H 3.

When the two points A and B are such that the straight line joining the two points passes through the centre of the circle, that is, when it is a diameter, then the two arcs are equal in length. When this is not the case, the two arcs are unequal in length. Then the shorter arc is called the minor arc and the longer arc is called the major arc. The angle  which is formed by joining the end points of the minor arc AB which is indicated by the thick line in the figure, to the centre, is defined as the angle subtended by the minor arc AB at the centre.

In the same manner, mark arcs of different lengths on circles of varying radii and repeat this activity. Through these activities you would have observed that the angle subtended at the centre by an arc is twice the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the same arc. This result is given as a theorem below. Now, by considering the following examples, let us see how calculations are performed using the above theorem.

The circle is divided into two regions by the chord. One is the region bounded by the chord and the major arc which is called the major segment. The other is the region bounded by the chord and the minor arc called the minor segment. The angle formed by joining the end points of the chord AB to a point on the arc of a segment is defined as an angle in the  is an angle in the segment. segment AXB .

The angle formed by joining a point on a semicircle to its end points is called an angle in the semicircle. Let us engage in the following activity to identify the properties of angles in a semicircle. 180 For free distribution                            You would have observed that the angle in the semi-circle is 90o.

Then draw a diameter of the circle. Now, the circle is divided into two semicircles. • Mark a point on one of the semicircles. Join this point to the two end points of the semicircle.

In the earlier grades, you used bearings and distances to indicate the position of a point on a horizontal plane. In this lesson, you will learn how to find the position of a point on a vertical plane by drawing a scale diagram using angles of elevation and angles of depression. An angle of elevation is defined as the angle formed between the line of vision and the eye level (horizontal level) of an observer when the observer is looking at an object above the eye level. An angle of depression is defined as the angle formed between the line of vision and the eye level (horizontal level) of an observer when the observer is looking at an object below the eye level.     When stating the position of an object in a vertical plane, we need to state the magnitude of the angle of elevation or depression. We may use a clinometer for the purpose of measuring these angles.   A simple clinometer can be made in the classroom as follows: • Cut out a semicircle with a radius of about 10 cm from a piece of cardboard. • Mark both ends of the curved edge as 90x and the middle of the curved edge as 0x. • Calibrate the curved edge in both directions from 0x, 10x by 10x as shown in the • Fix a straw along the straight edge of the semicircle. • Attach a small weight to one end of a piece of string longer than 10 cm and fix the When the straw is horizontal, the string goes through 0x. When the straw is inclined at an angle of 45x, for example, the string goes through 45x, in which case the straw shows a 45x vertical inclination. Angles of elevation and depression can be measured in this manner using a clinometer. Now let us consider several instances when scale diagrams are used to represent information in a vertical plane. The figure below shows a tree and its shadow on the ground. Let us draw a scale diagram using the given information and hence find the height of the tree. First we choose a suitable scale. Let 1 cm in the scale diagram represent an actual distance of 1 m. below using the clinometer you made.  (i) The top of the flagpole at your school.  (ii) The top of a building.  (iii) The top of a tree in your school. Accordingly, we need to draw a line segment of 6 cm to represent 6 m. Let us represent this by a horizontal line segment AB, (see the figure below). Now let us draw an angle of 50x at B and complete the triangle ABC such that BAC  = 90x as shown in the figure. C Now in the scale diagram, AC represents the height of the tree and you can measure and find that the length of AC is 7.2 cm. Hence, we can calculate the actual height of the tree as follows: Length of AC = 7.2 cm. Since 1 cm in the scale diagram represents 100 cm, From a sixty meter tall lighthouse a boat A is observed at sea with an angle of depression of 31x and another boat B with an angle of depression of 45x (see the figure). The two boats and the lighthouse are in the same vertical plane. Draw a scale diagram depicting the above information and find the distance between the boats A and B.                                                                                                                                               First let us draw a sketch diagram using the given information. Next let us choose a suitable scale. Let us represent 10 m by 1 cm. Since 1 m = 100 cm, In the chosen scale, 1 cm represents 1000 cm.  the scale is 1: 1000. According to the scale, a 6 cm line must be drawn to represent the lighthouse’s height. Denote this line by CD. • First draw a vertical line segment of length 6 cm and label it CD. • Draw two lines perpendicular to CD at C and D. • Draw an angle of depression of 31x at D. Extend this line to the point where it  = 4000 cm  = 40 m'                                             In a horizontal playground, Dilini is standing at the location A, 5 m away from a netball goal post. She can see the top of the goal post T, with an angle of elevation of 18x from her eye level E. She can see the base of the goal post F, from the same position with an angle of depression of 15x. Draw a scale diagram and find Dilini’s height and the height of the goal post. When a diagram is not given, it is best to draw a sketch diagram prior to drawing the scale diagram. Now, we have to choose a suitable scale for the scale diagram. Let us take 2 cm to represents 1 m. Then, 2 cm represent 100 cm.  1 cm represents 50 cm.  the scale is 1: 50. If 1 m is represented by 2 cm, 5 m is represented by 10 cm. Note: Because the distance between the human and the pole is not large, we get a more accurate answer by taking the man’s height into consideration when drawing the scale diagram. Now let us draw the scale diagram. • Because the distance between A and F is 5 m, draw a line segment of length 10 cm 18x 15x • Because the point E is not yet determined, we cannot draw the angle of elevation or depression at E at once. Instead, we first find E as follows. Observe that Now draw an angle AFE perpendicular to AF at A. • Now that we know point E, draw a line at E perpendicular AE. • Draw the angle of elevation of 18x with the line drawn in the previous step. Label the point T which is the intersection point of the line of sight of this angle of elevation and the line drawn perpendicular to AF at F, as shown in the figure. According to the scale diagram,  AE = 2.6 cm  Dilini’s height = 2.6 « 50 cm      
Also, from the scale diagram,  TF = 6 cm  the height of the goal post = 6 « 50 cm  = 300 cm  = 3 m'               Exercise 32.3 1.

The mathematics teacher Mr. Weerasekera asked Chanuka to find the height of an inaccessible mango tree. Chanuka finds, using his clinometer, that the angle of elevation of the highest point P of the tree from a point A on the horizontal ground is 30x and that the angle of elevation of the same point P from a point B which is 10 m closer to the tree than A is 40x. The points A, B and the mango tree are in the same vertical plane. Find, the height of the mango tree by drawing a suitable scale diagram. (Ignore Chanuka’s height). 400 m                                                       6.

The prefect Sithira was assigned the task of making arrangements for hoisting the national flag at the Independence Day celebration. Sithira needed to find the height of the flag pole. Form the upper floor of a building 10 m from the flagpole, using his clinometer, he observed the top of the flagpole with an angle of elevation of 20x and the bottom of the flagpole with an angle of depression of 50x. Draw a scale diagram using this information and find the height of the flag pole to the nearest metre. 8. The top, P, of a clock tower situated on a horizontal ground has an angle of elevation of 60x from a point A at the brink of a building.

Using a suitable scale diagram, find the height of the clock tower and the distance from A to the foot Q of the clock tower. 9.

Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to read and understand it on your own. e have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official Languages. Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the begin- ning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them for the subject content of grade 11. In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need to recall previuos knoweledge. You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and doing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them in the classroom. We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience. It is believed that the concept of numbers originated among the human race about 30 000 years ago. This concept which originated and developed independently in various civilizations, evolved globally and has now become a universal field of study named mathematics. It can be assumed that numbers were initially used in early civilizations for simple purposes such as counting and accounting. There is no doubt that the first numerical concepts that were developed were “one” and “two”. Later the concepts of three, four etc., must have been developed. Then man would have realized that he could name any amount that he wished in this manner. Different civilizations used different symbols to name numbers. It is accepted based on historical evidence, that the numerals 1, 2, 3 etc., which we now use, originated in India. The honour of being the first to use the concept of zero as a number as well as being the first to introduce the positional decimal number system also goes to India. This number system is now defined as the Hindu-Arabic number system and the modern belief is that it was first taken to the Middle-East and then to Europe by traders. This system is the standard number system which is accepted and used worldwide now. The manipulation of numbers using the basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) can be considered as a great revolution in the history of mankind in relation to the use of numbers. In this age of technology it is unimaginable to think of the existence of man without numbers and the operations performed on them. Although the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc., can be considered as the first numbers that were used to fulfill certain needs of man, later the number zero, fractional numbers and negative numbers were also included in the number system. During the period when mathematics was developing as a separate field, the attention of mathematicians was directed towards various other types of numbers (sets) too. In this lesson we hope to study about such sets of numbers, their notations and properties. By studying this lesson will be able to  ² to investigate number sets  ² workout basic mathematical operations regarding surds. It is natural that we identify initially the numbers 1, 2, 3, … which we first learnt about as children. These numbers are defined as counting numbers and the set which consists of all these numbers is written using set notation as follows. The reason for this set of numbers to be called the counting numbers is very clear. However its mathematical usage in modern times is limited. The name used most often now for this set is “the set of positive integers”. This set is denoted by The numbers defined as negative integers are – 1, – 2, – 3, etc. Although there is no commonly used symbol to denote this set, some mathematicians, based on the needs of their field of study, use the symbol The positive integers, zero and the negative integers together form the set of . Accordingly, integers. This set is denoted by Let us consider again the set of numbers 1, 2, 3,... This set is also defined as the set ' of natural numbers and is denoted by  Note: There is no consensus among mathematicians regarding which numbers should be considered as natural numbers. The suitability of calling the numbers 1, 2,3, … natural numbers is clear. However some of the mathematicians (especially specialists in set theory), have considered 0 as a natural number in their books.        One reason may be because at that time there was no accepted name nor accepted symbol for the set consisting of 0 and the positive integers.However most books on number theory consider the set of natural numbers to be the set {1, 2, 3,...}.Almost all authors of mathematics books now mention at the beginning of their books which set of numbers they consider as the natural numbers. We have come across earlier that, like the integers, fractions too can be considered as numbers, and that operations such as addition and multiplication can be performed on them too. Every integer can be written as a fraction. (For example, we can write 2 = ). Further, a fraction can be written in different forms, all having the same numerical value. (For example, 1  = ). We have also come across 2 , etc.&' Although we usually think that the numerator negative fractions ^– and denominator of a fraction should consist of integers, this is actually not the case. For example, 3  is also a fraction. However, fractions with integers in both 2 the numerator and the denominator (apart from 0 in the denominator), have an important place in mathematics. They are called rational numbers. The set of rational numbers is denoted by  . Accordingly, the set of rational numbers can be defined using the set builder notation as follows. , – 11 3 There are other ways too of defining the set of rational numbers. One other way is as follows. Both these definitions are equivalent. Since the denominator of a rational number cannot be 0 and since all the negative rational numbers can be obtained by considering the fractions with the negative integers in the numerator and positive integers in the denominator.  It is appropriate to define the irrational numbers now. Do you recall how you learnt about numbers in previous grades by drawing a number line? Let us reconsider this now. Let us consider a straight line which can be lengthened as required in either direction. Let us name a point we like on that line as the origin 0. Let us assume that we have marked all the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., on one side of 0 (usually the right hand side) and all the numbers – 1, – 2, – 3 etc., on the opposite side, keeping equal gaps between the numbers. That is, let us assume that the points corresponding to all the integers have been marked on this number line. Let us also assume that the points corresponding to all the rational numbers too have been marked on this line. Accordingly, all the rational numbers (including the integers) are now assumed to have been marked on this line. Now, do you think that corresponding to each point on the line, a number has been marked? If asked differently, do you think that the distance from 0 to each point on the line can be written as a rational number? In truth, there are several points remaining on the number line which have not been marked. That is, there are points remaining on this number line that cannot be represented by a rational number. It is clear that the points that are remaining are those which correspond to the numbers which cannot be written in the form  a , where a and b are integers. The numbers which correspond to the remaining b points are defined as irrational numbers. – 7 5 There is no specific symbol to denote the set of irrational numbers and it is usually . The numbers 2" 3" 5 can be denoted by given as examples of irrational numbers. In fact, the square root of any positive integer which is not a perfect square is an irrational number. Apart from these, mathematicians have proved that π, which is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter, is also an irrational number. We take the value of π to be 22 7 as an approximate value, for the convenience of performing calculations.  According to the above discussion, all the numbers on a number line can be represented by rational numbers or irrational numbers. We call all the rational numbers together with all the irrational numbers, that is, all the numbers that can be represented on a number line, the real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted by Any real number can be represented as a decimal number. Initially, let us consider the decimal representation of several rational numbers. A common property of these decimal representations is that starting at a certain point to the right of the decimal point (or from the beginning), one set of numerals (or one numeral) is recurring. Recurring means that it keeps repeating itself. or example, in the decimal representation of 1 , the numeral 0 recurs starting from 2 the second decimal place. The numeral 0 recurs from the first decimal place in the  1 2 = 0.5 = 0.5000 ...  11 8  211 99  767 150  37 7 decimal representation of 4, the pair of numerals 13 recurs from the beginning in the decimal representation of 211 99  37 7 . This property, that is, a group the beginning in the decimal representation of of numerals recurring continuously, is a property common to all rational numbers. If the portion that recurs is just 0, such a decimal representation is defined as a finite decimal (or terminating decimal). The decimals of which the portion that      " 4 and 11 8 recurs is not zero, are called recurring decimals. Accordingly, above example are finite decimals while the rest are recurring decimals. Every rational number can be written as a finite decimal or a recurring decimal. Let us now learn a marvelous result regarding rational numbers. Suppose the rational number a b b have no common factors. Then the denominator (that is, b) has only powers of 2 or 5 (or both) as its factors. A rational number which has a recurring decimal representation must have a prime factor other than 2 and 5 in its denominator. Recurring decimals are written in a concise form, by placing a dot above a numeral or numerals as shown in the following examples to indicate that they are recurring. . 12.4 . . 2.13 . 5.113 . . 5.285714 Exercise 1.1 1. For each of the following rational numbers state whether it is a finite decimal or a recurring decimal. Express the fractions which are recurring decimals in decimal form and then write them in a concise form. 19 33 13 50 i.  7 64  5 18 k. 15 128  l. 41 360        2. The decimal representation of an irrational number Finally, let us consider the decimal representation of an irrational number. In the decimal representation of an irrational number, no group of numerals recurs. For example, when the decimal representation of 2 is written down up to 60 decimal places, we obtain the following: π, which is a number we come across often is also an irrational number. When the value of π is calculated up to 60 decimal places we obtain the following: There is no group of recurring numerals in the decimal representation of an irrational number. If the decimal representation of a number is not finite, it is called an infinite decimal. Accordingly rational numbers which are recurring decimals and irrational numbers have infinite decimal representations. Note: When describing the decimal representation of irrational numbers, one frequent error that is made is stating that “there is no pattern in the decimal representation of an irrational number”. The issue here is that the word “pattern” is not well defined in mathematics. For example, the following decimal number has a very clear pattern. However, this is an irrational number, Observe that there is no group of recurring numbers. All the sets of numbers that have been studied so far can be represented in a Venn diagram as follows, with the set of real numbers as the universal set, and the other sets as its subsets. A few numbers belonging to each subset have been included to make it easier for you to understand the relationship between the sets. a. Any real number is a finite decimal or an infinite decimal. b. There can be rational numbers with infinite decimals representations. c. Any real number is a recurring decimal or an infinite decimal. d. 0.010110111011110... is a rational number.    2  √  2  √  √ 3  3  √   
π π 13 5 13 5 21 3 21 −2 −2    + N(=Z +      There is no doubt that you recall how numerical (and algebraic) expressions are  ˜ which is defined as the radical sign. For example, written using the symbol 4 is defined as the positive square root of 4 and it represents the positive number which when squared is equal to 4; that is 2. The positive square root is referred to as square root too. If a certain positive integer x is such that its square root x is also a positive integer, then x is defined as a perfect square. Accordingly, 4 is a perfect square. Since 4 is equal to 2. However, 2 is not the square root of a perfect square. We observed earlier that 2 is approximately equal to 1.414. We also learnt earlier in this lesson that 2 is an irrational number. A numerical term  of which the value is not a rational number is defined as involving the symbol a surd.  ˜ is used not only to denote the square roots of numbers, The radical sign — but also other roots. For example, 23  denotes the positive number which when raised to the power 3 is equal to 2. This is called the cube root of 2. This is also an irrational number. Its value is approximately 1.2599. (You can verify this by finding the value of 1.25993). We can define the fourth root of 2 and the fifth root of 2 etc., in a similar manner. Such definitions can be made for other positive numbers as well; for example, 53 . Such expressions are also surds. However, in this lesson we will only consider surds which are square roots of positive integers. 6  and 8.24  
The square root of a positive integer which is not a perfect square is neither a finite decimal nor a recurring decimal. Observe that surds are therefore always irrational numbers. Here our focus is on simplifying expressions which involve surds. There are many reasons why such simplifications are important. One reason is that it facilitates , if we calculations. For example, when it is necessary to find the value of take 2 to be approximately equal to 1.414, we would need to find the value of . This division is fairly long. However, by simplifying this in the following 1 1.414 manner, calculations are made easier. 1.414 2    For example, let us find the value of 20 2 value for 20 , and 2.2 as an approximate value for 5 . Then 20 2 = = 4.5 2 2.25 – 2.2 However, the actual value of this expression is 0. One reason for getting a different answer is because we used approximate values for 20 and 5 . However, by simplifying the above expression in a different way, we can get the correct value which is 0. Surds appear in various form. A special feature of a surd of the form 20 is that the whole number is under the radical sign. Such surds are defined as entire surds. 6 15 means 6 × 15. This is a product of a surd and a rational number (not equal to 1). This is not an entire surd. A surd is in its simplest form when it is in the form a b ; where a is a rational number and b has no factors which are perfect squares. For example 6 15 is in its simplest form but 5 12 is not, since 4 which is a perfect square is a factor of 12.  3 5 + 6 5 = 9 5 . This simplification is similar to the simplification 3x + 6x = 9x. Observe that the expression obtained above in surd form cannot be simplified further. Keep in mind that simplifying further by using an approximate value for You should also keep in mind the important fact that an expression of the form 3 2 + 8 3 cannot be simplified further. Now let us through examples, consider how expressions with surds are simplified by applying the properties of indices.        ( Since 4 = = 16 80 Example 4 Simplify: 5 3 4 2 . = 20 3 2 = 20 6 The surd 3 20 can be written as 3 4 5 . Simplifying further, it can be written as 3 2 5 = 6 5 ... 3 20 ..2 5 = 3 2 6 2               for such expressions are in the denominator. Now let us consider how such an expression can be converted into an expression with an integer (or a rational number) in the denominator. 2 2  by 2 3 2 Example 6 Express a Rationalise the denominator of b a b a b a  = – 9 7  = – 9 Example 8 Example 8 Simplify 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 . Simplify 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 . 4 63 = 4 9 7 = 4 3 7 4 63 = 4 9 7 = 4 3 7 8 28 = 8 4 7 = 8 2 7 8 28 = 8 4 7 = 8 2 7 = 12 7 = 12 7 = 16 7 = 16 7 Therefore 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 = 12 7 – 5 7 – 16 7 Therefore 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 = 12 7 – 5 7 – 16 7                2 Simplify 6 2 3 12 3 32 3 2 3 4 3 4 6 2 3 12 – 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 2. Convert the following surds into entire surds. 2    25 3 5              27 2 12 3 4 2 110 11 20 2          Do the following exercise to revise what you have learned so far about indices and logarithms.

Third power of 2 is 8' Thus, the cube root of 8 is 2. This can be denoted symbolically as"  2 2 2 = 21 21 21  = 23  = 8  Therefore it is clear that 8√ Futhermore, if a is a positive real number, then   ,  and '  a√ = a  3 a√  = a  4 a√  = a 4.

Thus, from 2x = 23 , we can conclude that x = 3' Similarly, on either side of the equation x5 = 25 are powers with equal exponents. Because the indices are equal, the bases are also equal. Therefore, from x5 = 25 we can conclude that x = 2' If x2 = 32 then the indices are equal but in this case, both + 3 and − 3 are solutions.

As a convention we write "lg" instead of "log10 ". Now we can express the above expression as lg 1000 = 3. It is important to mention the base if it is other than 10' For example"  log5 25 = 2 because 52 = 25,  lg 1 = 0 because 100 = 1" and  lg 10 = 1 because 101 = 10' The logarithm of any positive number can be found using the table of logarithms.

Let us now consider how to use the table of logarithms to obtain the logarithms of numbers between 0 and 1, by paying close attention to how we obtained the logarithms of numbers greater than 1. For this purpose, carefully investigate the following table.  5432  543.2  54.32  5.432  0.5432  0.05432  0.005432  0.0005432 5.432 103 5.432 102 5.432 101 5.432 100 5.432 10− 1 5.432 10− 2 5.432 10− 3 5.432 10− 4  3  2  1  0 0.7350 0.7350 0.7350 0.7350 3.7350 2.7350 1.7350 0.7350  1 −.7350  2 −.7350  3 −.7350  4 −.7350 According to the above table, the characteristic of the logarithm of numbers inbetween 0 and 1, coming after 5.432 in the first column, are negative' Even though the characteristic is negative, the mantissa of the logarithm, which is found using the table, is a positive number. The symbol —−˜ is used above the whole part to indicate that only the characteristic is negative. It is read as "bar". For example, 2 −.3725 is read as "bar two point three, seven, two, five"' Moreover, what is represented by 2 −.3725 is − 2 + 0.3725' The characteristic of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. The characteristic of the logarithm of such a number can be obtained either by writing it in scientific notation or by counting the number of zeros after the decimal point. The characteristic of the logarithm can be obtained by adding one to the number of zeros after the decimal point (and before the next non-zero digit) and taking its negative value. Observe it in the above table too. 0.004302 Number of zeros after the decimal point and before the next non-zero digit is 2. Therefore characteristic of the logarithm is 3−   characteristic of the logarithm is 2− Number of zeros after the decimal point is 0; thus the characteristic of the logarithm is 1−    herefore, lg 0.004302 = 3− .6337' When written using indices, it is; 0.004302 = 103− .6337' This can also be written as" 0.004302 = 10 −3 100.6337' Do the following exercise to practice taking logarithms of numbers between 0 and 1. a. 0.831  d. 0.009 b. 0.01175 e. 0.00005 c. 0.0034 f. 0.00098 When a number is written in scientific form, the index of the power of 10 is the characteristic of the logarithm of that number. The characteristic of the logarithm indicates the number of places that the decimal point needs to be shifted when taking the antilog. Thus, we obtained 552.2 by shifting the decimal point of 5.522 two places to the right. However, when the characteristic is negative the decimal point is shifted to the left side. 30 a. 0.9843  d. 0.0019 b. 0.05 e. 0.003141 c. 0.0725 f. 0.000783 2.

But we now know that, the characteristic can be positive, negative or zero. In 2−. 5143, the mantissa, .5143, is positive and the characteristic, 2−, is negative' When adding or subtracting such numbers, it is important to simplify the characteristic and the mantissa separately.

Carefully observe the solid objects in the above figure. Note that their faces are polygons. Of these faces, the horizontal face at the bottom is called the base. All the faces, except the base are of triangular shape. The common point of these triangular faces is called the "apex". A solid object with these properties is called a "pyramid". Note that the bases of the Pyramids shown above are respectively, the shape of a quadrilateral, a pentagon and a hexagon. Slant edge Perpendicular height The base of the pyramid in the figure is a square. All the remaining faces are triangular in shape. If the line segment connecting the apex and the midpoint of the square base (that is the intersection point of the two diagonals) is perpendicular to the base, then such a pyramid is called a "square based right pyramid". The length of the line segment connecting the apex and the midpoint of the base is called the perpendicular height (or simply the height) of the pyramid. The edges of the triangular faces which are not common to the base are called slant edges. In this lesson, we will only consider finding the surface area of square based right pyramids. 50 ² find the surface area of a right pyramid with a square base, ² find the surface area of a right circular cone, and ² find the surface area of a sphere.    Note: A tetrahedron can also be considered as a pyramid. All the faces of a tetrahedron are triangular in shape. Any one of the faces can be taken as the base. The concept of —right pyramid˜ can be defined even when the base is not a square. For example, we can define a right pyramid when the base of a pyramid is a regular polygon, as follows. First note that all the axes of symmetry of a regular polygon pass through a common point, which is called the centroid of the regular polygon. A pyramid, having a base which is a regular polygon, is called a right pyramid, if the line segment connecting the apex and the centroid of the base is perpendicular to the base. If you study mathematics further, you will learn how to define the centroid, even when the base is not a regular polygon. An important property of a square based right pyramid is that all its triangular faces are congruent to each other. Therefore, all the triangular faces have the same area. Moreover, note that each triangular face is an isosceles or an equilateral triangle, with one side a side of the square base and the other two sides equal in length. To find the total surface area of a square based right pyramid we need to add the areas of the base and the four triangular faces. Suppose the length of a side of the square base is —a˜ and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is "l". Perpendicular height (h) Perpendicular height of the triangular face (l) (There are 4 such faces) Area of the square base Area of a triangular face a a + 4 a2 + 2al Total surface area of the square based right pyramid = If the total surface area is A, Let us now consider some solved examples on the surface area of a square based right pyramid. The base length of a square based right pyramid is 10 cm and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is 15 cm. Find the total surface area of the pyramid. = 10 10 = 100 = 1 2 = 75 Shown in the figure is a square based right pyramid of perpendicular height 8 cm and base length 12 cm. Find  (i) the perpendicular height of a triangular face,  (ii) the area of a triangular face, and  (iii) the total surface area of the pyramid. Let us take the perpendicular height of a triangular face to be l cm. Consider the shaded triangle in the above figure.          (i) l2 = 82 + 62 = 64 + 36 = 100    = 144 + 240  = 384 1.

The area of the fabric that is used to make a tent in the shape of a square based right pyramid, is 80 m2. Find the height of the tent, if the fabric is not used for the base of the tent and the length of a side of the base is 8cm. 9. The height of a tent in the shape of a square based right pyramid is 4m and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is 5 m. If both the roof and the base of the tent is to be made from fabric, how much material is required? 0.It is required to construct a tent in the shape of a square based pyramid of base length 16 m and height 6 m. Find the fabric needed to construct the tent, also covering the base.                                                                                 Shown above are some conical (cone shaped) objects. A cone has a circular plane surface and a curved surface. The circular plane surface is called the base of the cone. The point through which all the straight lines drawn on the curved surface pass through is called the "apex" of the cone. Curved surface perpendicular  height A cone is called a right circular cone if the line segment connecting the apex and the centre of is perpendicular to the circular base of a right circle cone. The radius of the base circle is called the radius of the cone. The length of the line segment connecting the centre of the base and the apex is the perpendicular height of a right circular cone. Moreover, any line segment connecting the apex and a point on the perimeter of the base circle is called a generator of the cone. The length of a generator is called the "slant height " of the cone. It is customary to use —r˜ for the radius, —h˜ for the height and —l˜ for the slant height of a cone. To explain a method to find the surface area of a right circular cone, consider a hollow right circular cone made from a thin sheet. Observe that the base of such a cone is a circular plane surface. Cutting open the curved surface along a generator, gives a lamina, the shape of a circular sector. Given the radius and the slant height of a right circular cone, one can find surface area of the cone, by finding the area of the circular base and the area of the curved surface. We can use the formula πr2 to find the area of the circular base. We can find the area of the circular sector as follows.   The area of the sector with the above angle θ (as learnt in grade 10) is θ 360 360r l πl 2 360 area of the curved surface of the cone area of the circular base Total surface area of the cone Let us now consider some solved examples on the surface area of a cone. In this lesson let us take the value of π as 22  7 Shown in the figure is a solid right circular cone. Its radius is 7 cm and slant height is 12 cm. Find the total surface area of the cone. The surface area of the curved surface is equal to the area of the sector that is obtained by cutting it open. Because the arc length of the sector is the circumference of the base circle, the arc length of the sector is equal to 2πr. Also note that the radius of this sector is the slant height —l˜. Now, as you have learned in the lesson on the perimeter of a circular sector in Grade 10, if the angle of the sector is θ then θ 360 360r l       = πrl 22  7 = 264

There is no doubt that you know what properties a sphere has. In mathematics, a sphere is defined as the set of points in three dimensional space that lies at a constant distance from a fixed point. The fixed point is called the centre of the sphere and the constant distance from the centre to a point on the sphere is called the radius of the sphere. A sphere has only one curved surface, and has no edges or vertices. curved surface is 396 cm2 , find  (i) the radius of the cone, and  (ii) the perpendicular height of the cone. Shown in the picture, is a thin glass container in the shape of a cone filled with a juice to half its height. The radius of the glass is 12 cm and its height is 16 cm. Find the area of the region on the glass surface that is in contact with the juice.               A cylinder with the same radius as the sphere and height equal to the diameter of the sphere is called the circumscribing cylinder of the sphere. The sphere will tightly fit in the circumscribing cylinder of the sphere. The following fact regarding the surface area of a sphere and its circumscribing cylinder was observed by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, who lived around 225 B.C.  D S  C When the sphere is inside the circumscribing cylinder, any two planes parallel to the flat circular surfaces of the cylinder will bound equal surface areas on the curved surfaces of the sphere and cylinder. A B For example, in the above figure, the area of the curved surface PQRS on the sphere is the same as the area of the curved surface ABCD on the cylinder. Now, if we apply this fact to the entire cylinder, we see that the surface area of the sphere is equal to the surface area of the curved surface of the cylinder. We can use the formulae 2πrh to find the surface area of the curved surface of the circumscribing cylinder.  = 4πr2  Therefore, the surface area of the sphere = 4πr2      Surface area of the sphere = 4πr2  22  7

Review Exercise 1. Shown below are figures of some solid objects that you have studied before.        By studying this lesson you will be able to  • compute the volume of a square based right pyramid, right circular cone and a Let us do the following activity to construct a formula to find the volume of a square based right pyramid. Use a piece of cardboard to construct the hollow cuboid and the hollow pyramid, shown in the following figure. The cuboid has a square base with 6 cm sides and is of height 10 cm. It does not have a top. The right pyramid has a square base, again with 6 cm sides, and the height of the pyramid is also 10 cm. Do not include a base, so that you can fill it with sand. You would have observed in the above activity, that filling the pyramid completely with sand and emptying it into the cuboid thrice, will completely fill the cuboid without any overflow. Let us consider a square based cuboid with side length a and height h, and a square based right pyramid of side length a and height h. Completely fill the pyramid with sand and empty it into the cuboid. Find how many times you need to do this to fill the cuboid.

Archimedes, the Greek mathematician who explained the surface area of a sphere in terms of the circumscribing cylinder, also explained the volume of a sphere in terms of the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. Let us do the following activity to understand his finding.  Find a small sphere of radius 3 cm.

Cover top with a piece of cardboad and flip it over and fill the remaining part that is not occupied by the sphere also with sand. Put the total amount of sand that you used to fill the remaining volume of the cylinder after inserting the sphere into the cone that you made earlier. Note that the volume of sand fills the cone completely. Therefore, we can find the volume of the sphere by subtracting the volume of the cone from the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.

O 1440       You have learned in earlier lessons that, for a binomial expression of the form x + y, its square is denoted by (x + y)2, and that what it means is (x + y) (x + y), and that when the product is expanded, the expression x2 + 2xy + y2 is obtained. Moreover, recall that x2 – 2xy + y2 is obtained when (x – y)2 is expanded. Do the following exercise to recall what you have learned about the expansion of squares of binomial expressions. Review Exercise 1. Fill in the blanks.  The cube of the binomial expression a + b , is (a + b)3 .

It is illustrated in the following example'  = x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y + 2xy2 + y3  = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3 Accordingly, let us remember the following pattern as a formula for the expansion of the cube of the binomial expression (x + y). cube of the second term three times the product of the square of the first term and the second term. three times the product of the first term and the square of the second term                 Similarly, we can write (a + 2)3 = a3 + 3a2 × 2 + 3a × 22 + 23, and this can be further simplified as " a3 + 6a2 + 12a + 8 Now let us consider how the expansion of (x – y)3 is obtained by taking products. = x3 – 2x2y + xy2 – x2y +2xy2 – y3 = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3 Now, let us consider how we can obtain the expansion of (x – y)3, using another method. First, note that we can write x – y as x + (– y)' Therefore, we can treat (x – y)3 as an expression of the initial form, by writing it as {x + (– y)}3' Let us now consider the expansion of this cube. (x – y)3 = {x + (– y)}3 = x3 + 3 × x2 × (– y) + 3 × x × (– y)2 + (– y)3  = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3  Note that we have used the properties (– y)2 = y 2 and (– y)3 = – y 3 in the above simplification. (m – n)3 = m3 – 3m2n + 3mn2 – n3 (p – q)3 = p3 – 3p2q + 3pq2 – q3 method which is easy for you. Let us now consider how the cube of a binomial expression, involving numbers as well, is expanded.

These simplifications can be done either before multiplying the fractions or after multiplying the fractions. Let us now consider multiplying two fractions where such simplifications are possible. 80 Do the following exercise to revise what you have learned before on adding and subtracting algebraic fractions. Two algebraic fractions can be multiplied in the same way that two numerical fractions are multiplied. Let us consider the following example. What we mean by performing the multiplication is to express this product as a single fraction.  x 3 To perform this multiplication, we multiply the numerators and denominators of the two fractions separately, and obtain a single fraction. That is, x x × 2 3 x x× 2 × 3  x2 6 7 3m  3 4m  8– m a + 3 a2 – 4  1 + a + 2 1 m + 2  2 m + 3  3– x 9 x + 2  1 x 2a 5 2 x2 – x – 2  1 x2 – 1 1 x2 – 9x + 20  1 x2 – 11x + 30 By studying this lesson, you will understand  how algebraic fractions are multiplied and divided. Here, we can cancel the common factor 2, of the numerator 8 of the first fraction and the denominator 2b of the second fraction. We perform this simplification as follows.  3 2b × 1  3 2b Now, by multiplying the expressions in the numerators and denominators of the two fractions separately, we get a single fraction as given below.  3 2b 4 3× a × b 12 ab  3 2b We can also cancel the common factors after multiplying the fractions. Consider the following example. However, by cancelling the common factors before doing this the multiplication, you can minimise long multiplications and divisions. Therefore, doing this is encouraged. 3 2a 2b 3 6b= 6a  4 5x  4 5x 1 4× y × 5 4 5y When multiplying fractions with algebraic expressions in the numerator and the denominator, first factorise the expressions. This is done to cancel the common factors if there are any.

You multiplied the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Similarly, when dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction, we can instead multiply the first by the reciprocal of the second. Before we study how algebraic fractions are divided, let us consider the reciprocal of an algebraic fraction. Recall the facts we have leaned regarding the reciprocal of a number. If the product of two numbers is 1, then each number is the reciprocal or the multiplicative inverse of the other number. The reciprocal of an algebraic fraction is also described similarly. That is, if the product of two algebraic fractions is 1, then each algebraic fraction is the reciprocal of the other. 5 ×x x 5 1 1 x + 1 y y x + 1 y x + 1 y x + 1 x + 1 . y    a b  a 4 ×  ab  4 ab 4  b 2  a b ab ÷  4  a b ab ÷  4 by simply interchanging the numerator and denominator, as you have done with numerical fractions.

Let us now recall how the areas of triangles and parallelograms are found. When finding the areas of triangles and parallelograms, the terms altitude and base are used. Let us first recall what these terms mean. When finding the area of a triangle, any one of its sides can be considered as the base. For example, the side BC of the triangle ABC can be considered as the base. Then AD is the corresponding altitude; that is, the perpendicular dropped from the vertex A to the side BC. Similarly, if we consider the side AB to be the base, the corresponding altitude is CE. Accordingly, we can also write, We know that, area of triangle ABC = We can similarly find the area of the triangle ABC by taking AC as the base and drawing the corresponding altitude from the vertex B.  identify the theorems on the relationships between the areas of triangles and parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines, and solve problems related to them.      Now let us consider the parallelogram PQRS. Here too, the area can be found by considering any one of the sides as the base. If we consider the side QR as the base, the corresponding altitude is the line segment PM. The length of PM is the distance between the two parallel straight line segments QR and PS, the side opposite QR. Similarly, if we consider the side PQ as the base, the corresponding altitude is RN. Therefore we can also write, Note The length of the altitude of a triangle or a parallelogram is also often called the altitude. To recall what has been learnt earlier regarding finding the areas of parallelograms and triangles, do the following exercise by applying the above facts.    Let us first see what is meant by parallelograms and triangles on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Consider the following figures.  Both the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF in figure (i) lie between the pair of straight lines AB and DE. What is meant here by the word “between” is that a pair  Both the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF in figure (i) lie between the pair of of opposite sides of each of the parallelograms lies on the straight lines AB and straight lines AB and DE. What is meant here by the word “between” is that a pair DE. Further, the side AB is common to both parallelograms. In such a situation, of opposite sides of each of the parallelograms lies on the straight lines AB and we say that the two parallelograms are on the same base and between the same DE. Further, the side AB is common to both parallelograms. In such a situation, pair of parallel lines. Here, the common side AB has been considered as the base. we say that the two parallelograms are on the same base and between the same It is clear that corresponding to this common base, both the parallelograms have pair of parallel lines. Here, the common side AB has been considered as the base. the same altitude. This is equal to the perpendicular distance between the two It is clear that corresponding to this common base, both the parallelograms have parallel lines AB and DE. the same altitude. This is equal to the perpendicular distance between the two parallel lines AB and DE.  Figure (ii) depicts a parallelogram and a triangle which lie on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC. The parallelogram is ABCD  Figure (ii) depicts a parallelogram and a triangle which lie on the same base and and the triangle is ABE. The common base is AB. Observe that in this case, one between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC. The parallelogram is ABCD side of the triangle lies on one of the parallel lines while the opposite vertex lies and the triangle is ABE. The common base is AB. Observe that in this case, one on the other line. side of the triangle and the opposite vertex lies on each parallel straight lines.  Figure (iii) depicts two triangles on the same base and between the same pair of  Figure (iii) depicts two triangles on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines.

Write down all the triangles with the same base OP lie between the pair of parallel straight lines AQ and CP in the given figure. the perpendicular distance between the pair of parallel straight lines AB and CD is denoted by h and the base lengths of the parallelograms by a and b. Write down the areas of the parallelograms PQRS, KLSR and MNUT in terms of these symbols. the parallelogram PQMN in the given figure lie between the pair of parallel straight lines AB and CD. NM = 10 cm and LM = 8 cm.                         Next we look at the relationship between the areas of parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Consider the given parallelograms. Observe that, area of parallelogram ABCD = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle AFD area of parallelogram ABEF = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle BEC Therefore it is clear that, if the area of triangle AFD = the area of triangle BEC, then the areas of the two parallelograms will be equal. In fact, these two triangles are congruent. Therefore their areas are equal. The congruence of the two triangles under the conditions of SAS can be shown as follows. AD = BC (opposite sides of a parallelogram) AF = BE (opposite sides of a parallelogram) Also, since DAB angles), by subtracting these equations we obtain Therefore we obtain, area of parallelogram ABCD = area of parallelogram ABEF.  DAF Accordingly, the two triangles AFD and BEC are congruent under the conditions of SAS.      Now let us obtain an important result using this theorem. You have used the following formula when finding the area of a parallelogram in previous grades and in the above exercise. Have you ever thought about how this result was obtained? We can now use the above theorem to prove this result. The figure depicts a rectangle ABCD (that is, a parallelogram) and a parallelogram ABEF on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. According to the above theorem, their areas are equal. We know that, area of the parallelogram ABEF = Area of the rectangle ABCD = AB AD = AB perpendicular distance between the  two parallel lines = base of the parallelogram perpendicular height             (ii) What is the area of the parallelogram ABCD?  (iii) Find the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines AB and FC. Now let us answer these questions.  (i) ABEF and ABCD.  (ii) Since the parallelograms ABEF and ABCD lie on the same base AB and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and FC, their areas are equal. Therefore, the area of ABCD = 80 cm2.  80 = 8 h  ... h = 10  (i) show that ABQD and ABCP are parallelograms. (ii) show that the parallelograms ABQD and ABCP are of the same area. ^iii& prove that ^iv& prove that, area of parallelogram AXQR = area of parallelogram BXPS. ^i& In the quadrilateral ABQD (given)  AB//DQ (given)  AD//BQ Since a quadrilateral with pairs of opposite sides parallel, is a parallelogram, ABQD is a parallelogram. Similarly, since AB // PC and AP // BC, we obtain that ABCP is a parallelogram.              ^ii& Since the parallelograms ABQD and ABCP lie on the same base AB and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC, by the above theorem, their areas are equal.  SCP = RQD  Further, AB = PC (opposite sides of the parallelogram ABCP)   Therefore, PC = DQ. ... Therefore, by subtracting the area of the triangle ABX from both sides, we get area of trapezium ABQR  ... area of parallelogram AXQR = area of parallelogram BXPS.  ABSP

Based on the information in the figure, prove that the area of triangle ADP is equal to the area of triangle BRC.  and AD = 5 cm. Construct the rhombus ABEF equal in area to the area of ABCD and lying on the same side of AB as the parallelogram. State the theorem that you used for your construction.        Now let us draw a line parallel to AB through the point C, as shown in the figure, and mark the point D on this line such that ABDC is a parallelogram. In other words let us mark the intersection point of the line drawn through B parallel to AC and the line drawn through C parallel to AB, as D. The area of the triangle ABC is exactly half the area of the parallelogram ABDC. This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. We learnt this in the lesson on parallelograms in Grade 10. Therefore, area of triangle ABC =             In section 8.2 of this lesson, we learnt that the areas of parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines are equal. Therefore, in relation to the above figure, the area of any parallelogram that lies on the same base AB and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD is equal to the area of ABDC. Therefore, area of triangle ABC = The figure illustrates a parallelogram PQRS and a triangle STR on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. The area of the parallelogram PQRS is 60 cm2.  (i)The parallelogram PQRS and the triangle STR lie on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Therefore the area of triangle STR is half the area of parallelogram PQRS.

Now let us consider the two triangles PQR and TQR that lie on the same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD. U As discussed in section 8.3 the parallelogram related to the triangle PQR is PQRS, and the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU. However, since the parallelograms PQRS and TQRU lie on the same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines, by the theorem, area of parallelogram PQRS = area of parallelogram TQRU. ... As stated previously, the areas of the two triangles PQR and TQR which lie on the same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD are equal in area. Triangles which satisfy the above given conditions in this manner are equal in area. This is stated as a theorem as follows.   Let us now consider through the following examples how problems are solved using this theorem. (ii) If the area of triangle ABC is 30 cm2, find the area of triangle ABD.

Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to read and understand it on your own. e have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official Languages. Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the beginning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them for the subject content of grade 11. In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need to recall previuos knoweledge. You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and doing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them in the classroom. We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience. Review Exercise 1. Compute the following percentages. a. 12% of 800 rupees. c. 2.5% of 1200 g.    Our daily household expenses fall into two main categories as capital expenses and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are the expenses we incur on a regular basis and would include our spending on food, clothes, medicine and electricity bills. Capital expenses are one-time expenses that are not repeated on a regular basis. For instance our spending on purchasing a land, a house, a vehicle, machinery or furniture is a capital expense. Such purchases are generally of significant value and may often require a loan from the place of work or from a financial institution. b. 8% of 1 Kilometre. d. 25% of 2.5 Litres. 5. Sunimal takes out a loan of Rs 10 000 that charges a monthly simple interest rate of 2%. What is the total amount that he will re-pay if he wants to settle the entire loan in 3 months? By studying this lesson, you will be able to: • compute the loan instalment when the interest is computed on the reducing Money borrowed as a loan is not paid back in full right away. Rather, it is paid back over a long period of time as monthly partial payments.Usually a loan is expected to be repaid with interest. The part of the loan and the interest that is to be paid every month is referred to as a loan instalment. However, some manufacturers or distributors may sell their merchandise on an interest free installment plan to promote sales. Example 1 A furniture manufacturer sells a Rs 30 000 worth wooden wardrobe on an interest free scheme of 12 monthly payments.What is the amount paid as an instalment? Example 2 A festival advance of Rs 5000 is given to employees of government institutions. This interest free advance has to be paid back in 10 equal monthly instalments. If each installment is deducted from the salary, what is the amount deducted from the salary each month? The amount deducted from the monthly salary each month = Rs 5 000 10 There are several ways of charging interest on a loan. Calculating the loan interest on the reducing balance is a common method. Let us explore this. When you borrow money to repay in monthly instalments, or if you purchase an item with a down payment with the understanding that the rest of the money will be paid in instalments, most of the time you will be expected to pay an interest on the loan. Here, the loan is paid in monthly instalments. The interest calculation is based on the outstanding loan balance. That is the balance money that remains in the borrowers hands as the loan is repaid during the loan term. As the borrower repays instalments, the remaining loan balance reduces over time. Interest is then charged only on the loan amount that the borrower still holds. Therefore this method of calculating the interest is called, computing the interest on the reducing balance.                         Once the total interest to be paid is calculated, the monthly installments are determined, such that every installment is of the same value. Study the following examples to understand the method of calculating the loan interest on the reducing balance and the value of an installment. Example 1 Mr Wickramasinghe has borrowed Rs 30 000 as a business loan from a bank that charges an annual interest rate of 24%. The loan has to be paid back in six equal monthly instalments and the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Calculate the value of a monthly instalment.  The loan amount = Rs 30 000  Amount due from the principal loan per month without interest = Rs 30 000  In this method, the outstanding loan balance is reduced by Rs 5000 every month and interest is charged only on the loan balance. Annual interest rate  Monthly interest rate = 24% = 2% = Rs 20 000 = Rs 400  2 100  2 100  2 100  2 100  2 100                                              2 100 Calculating the interest as in the above method could be lengthy and time consuming. Therefore we adopt the following easier method to calculate the interest. Interest charged on amount due per month from the principal loan   
 2 100 Therefore, the total interest paid = Rs 100 6 + 100 5 + 100 4 + 100 3 + 100 2 + 100 1  = Rs 100 (6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)  = Rs 100 21  = Rs 2 100 where 21 is the total number of portions of the loan that is to be paid within the six months.We will call this the number of month units. We calculate the number of month units as This can be thought of as a sum of an arithmetic progression and can be found using the formula n 2  6 2 = 3 7 = 21                                                Example 2 A television priced at Rs 25 000 can be purchased by making a down payment of Rs 7 000 and paying the remainder by 12 equal monthly installments. If an annual interest rate of 18% is charged on the loan,where the interest is calculated on the reducing balance, find the value of a monthly installment. Price of the television = Rs 25 000 The down payment = Rs 7 000 ∴ Interest paid for a month unit = Rs 1 500 18 100  1 12  12 2 = 6 13 = 78 Example 3 The following advertisement was displayed in a shop: If the interest on the loan was calculated on the reducing loan balance, calculate the interest rate.  number of instalments 2 A washing machine worth Rs 30 000 is available for a down payment of Rs 5000 and 10 equal monthly instalments of Rs 2720.                    Price of the washing machine = Rs 30 000  The down payment = Rs 5 000   10 2  = 55 2. A government servant can acquire a loan up to ten times of his monthly salary at an annual interest rate of 4.2%. The loan has to be repaid within 5 years in equal monthly instalments. If Nimal draws a salary of Rs 30 000 per month; determine the following.  (i) How much can Nimal acquire as a loan?  (ii) What is the duration of the loan in months? (iii) If the interest is charged on the reducing balance, calculate the total  (i) Find the amount due from the principal loan amount each month.  (ii) Find the interest charged on the principal loan amount each month. (iii) For how many month units should she pay the interest? (iv) Find the total interest she should pay under the reducing loan balance  (v) Find the amount of a monthly installment. (iv) What is the total amount due under the reducing loan balance?  (v) Find the amount of a monthly installment.                        3. A dining table worth Rs 35 000 can be purchased with a Rs 5000 cash down payment and the rest paid in 15 equal monthly instalments. If the loan is charged an 18% annual interest on the reducing loan balance, calculate the amount of a monthly installment. 4. A motor cycle priced at Rs 150 000 for outright purchase can be bought by making a down payment of Rs 30 000 and paying the rest in 2 years in equal monthly installments. If a 24% annual interest rate is charged on the loan, where the interest is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the amount of a monthly installment. 5. Mr Kumar has acquired a loan of Rs 12 000 which he intends to repay in 6 equal monthly instalments. The amount paid in a monthly installment is Rs 2 100. 6. A refrigerator priced at Rs 36 000 for outright purchase can be bought by making a down payment of Rs 6 000 and paying the rest in 24 equal monthly installments of Rs 1 500. If the interest on the loan is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the annual interest rate. 7. A sewing machine is available at Rs 23 000 for outright purchase. A person going for an installment plan can purchase it by making a down payment of 5 000 and paying the rest in 10 equal monthly installments of Rs 2 000. If the interest on the loan is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the annual interest rate. An alternative way of calculating interest for an amount of money borrowed or deposited is the compound interest method. Let us explore how the interest is calculated under this method through an example. At a bank that pays an annual interest rate of 10%, the account statement provided at the end of 3 years, to a person who has maintained a Rs 25 000 fixed account is as follows.  (i) Find the amount due from the principal loan amount each month.  (ii) Find the total interest he should pay. (iii) Find the total amount paid in insallments. (iv) What is the number of month units?  (v) Find the interest for a month unit. (vi) Find the annual interst rate.       2014.12.31 2015.01.01 2015.12.31 2016.01.01 interest balance interest balance _ 30 250.00 _ 33 275. 00 2 750.00 _ 3 025.00 _ According to the above statement the depositor has earned Rs 2 500 as interest in the year 2013. It is clear that the interest earned is 10% of the principal deposit. The sum of the money deposited in 2013 and the interest earned in the year 2013 that amounts to 27 500 is considered as the total in the account on 2014.01.01. Furthermore, the interest earned in the year 2014 is 2750 and it is 10% of the total Rs 27500. It is apparent that the interest earned at the end of the year is added to the account balance and the interest for the next year is calculate on the new balance. In this manner, when the interest is calculated every year, not only the principal but the previously earned interest also earns interest. The addition of interest to the principal is called compounding and the interest calculation on the compounded amount is called the compound interest method. The compound interest method can be used when calculating interest on a loan as well as on a deposit. Example 1 If a person takes a loan of Rs 10 000 at a compound interest rate of 10% per year, calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.  Interest for the first year = Rs 10 000 10 100  Interest for the second year = Rs 11 000 10 100                           As in the above example, compound interest can be calculated separately for each year and added to the loan amount to find the total loan amount due. Example 2 Amal invests Rs 50 000 for 3 years in a fixed deposit account which pays 6% annual interest compounded yearly. Nimal invests Rs 50 000 in an account which pays 6% annual simple interest. Calculate the amounts received by Amal and Nimal at the end of three years separately. Total amount received by Amal at the end of the first year = Rs 50 000 106 100 Total amount received by Amal at the end of the second year = Rs 53 000 106 100 Total amount received by Amal at the end of the third year = Rs 56 180 106 100 = Rs 50 000 6 100 s 50 000 106 100  106 100  106 100                3. Radha deposits Rs 8 000 in an account paying 12% annual interest compounded yearly. After one year the bank interest rate drops to 10%. How much money will Radha receive in total as interest at the end of 2 years? 4. Hashan and Caseem are two friends. If Hashan lends Rs 25 000 at a simple annual interest rate of 15% and Caseem lends 25 000 at an interest rate of 14% compounded yearly on the same date, calculate who receives more money after three years. 5. At the beginning of a year a person deposits Rs 40 000 in a bank that pays 12% annual interest compounded every six month (semi annually). Compute how much money in total he receives at the end of the year. 6. A person who has loaned a certain amount at 8% interest compounded yearly, receives Rs 432 as compound interest at the end of two years. Find the amount that he loaned. 1. A television is priced at Rs 45 000. A person who buys it outright for cash, receives a discount of 6% and a person going for an instalment plan can make a down payment of Rs 9 000 and pay the remainder in 12 equal monthly instalments. A 24% annual interest rate is charged on the loan, where the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. (a) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought outright for cash? (b) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought on an instalment plan? (c) How profitable is it to buy the TV outright for cash than on an installment 2. A person takes a loan of Rs 100 000 at an interest rate of 4.2% compounded annually and deposits it in a bank that pays 8% interest compounded annually. What is the profit of his investment after 2 years? 3. A person takes a loan at a certain interest rate compounded annually. If he has to pay Rs 14 400 to settle the entire loan in 2 years or Rs 17 280 to settle it in 3 years, calculate the amount he borrowed and the compound interest rate. In this lesson we will consider businesses in Sri Lanka which are incorporated companies registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. These companies may be owned by an individual or a group of individuals. Of these companies, the companies which are limited by shares can be classified as follows. ² Private limited companies ² Public limited companies Public limited companies raise capital to commence or continue their business by issuing shares or debentures to the general public. The public is notified regarding the issue of shares through the media. When the public buy shares, they have the right to sell these shares to others. The stock market is where the trading of these shares occurs. The Stock Market (Stock Exchange) is a place where securities such as shares and debentures issued by companies are traded. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is the organization responsible for the operation of the stock market in Sri Lanka. The CSE is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to operate as a stock market in Sri Lanka. The SEC regulates and oversees the stock market. Companies are admitted to the official list of the CSE as listed companies. On April 21st 2015 there were 297 companies listed in the Sri Lankan stock market. The public who wish to buy or sell securities in the stock market must register with one or more of the 15 licensed stockbroker firms of the CSE who attend to the transactions. Some brokers offer trading through the internet. • identify the stock market and its nature • identify terms related to the stock market • calculate the dividends gained by investing in the stock market • solve problems related to shares       Public limited companies which are listed in the stock market, that wish to raise capital by involving the public, do this by issuing “shares”. A share is one of the equal parts into which a company’s stated capital is divided. When a company issues new shares, the price of a share is decided by the company itself. The public can invest in as many shares as they like. An investor who buys shares in a company becomes a part owner of that company. The stake he has in the company is proportional to the number of shares he owns. 10 0 00 100 000 10 0 00 100 000 Company C which has a stated capital of Rs 10 000 000, issues 100 000 shares to the public at Rs 100 per share. Vishwa buys 5000 of these shares.  (b) as a percentage. (ii) Find the amount that Vishwa invested in company C. 5 0 00 100 000           Price of a share (ii)  The number of shares Vishwa purchased The amount Vishwa invested  = Rs 100  = 5 000  = Rs 100 5 000 = Rs 500 000 When a listed company issues new shares, it gives notice of the benefits that shareholders will enjoy. Dividends are payments out of the earnings of the company which some companies give their shareholders as a benefit. It is expressed in terms of the amount paid per share. This is paid out quarterly or annually. For example, a company may pay its shareholders annual dividends of Rs 5 per share. The company has the right to change this amount with time. Let us consider again the above example to clarify this further. Example 1 Company C pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, for the Rs 100 shares it issued, of which Vishwa bought 5 000 shares. (i) Find the annual income that Vishwa receives through this investment. (ii) Express Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage of the amount he  invested. (i) The number of shares Vishwa owns = 5000 Annual dividends per share = Rs 4  ... Vishwa’s annual income = Rs 5000 4  (ii) Amount that Vishwa invested = Rs 100 5 000 = Rs 100 5 000  20 000 50 0 000 Now do the following exercise pertaining to the facts on initial investments in shares.                                             Exercise 10.1 1. An investor purchases 1000 shares of value Rs 25 per share in the company Sasiri  (i) How much did the person invest?  (ii) If the company pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, find the investor’s 2. Complete the following tables.  (i) Number of shares 2500 Number of shares 500 Annual dividends per share (Rs) 2 3. A public limited company issues 10 000 000 shares to the public at Rs 25 per share to raise its capital. The company pays annual dividends of Rs 5 per share. Sujeeva purchases 50 000 shares in this company.  (i) Find the stated capital of this company.  (ii)  (iii) Find the dividends Sujeeva receives annually through this investment in shares.  (iv) What percent of the amount he invested is the annual dividends he receives?  4. Mehela bought a certain number of shares at Rs 20 per share in a company which pays annual dividends of Rs 3 per share. His dividends income at the end of a year from this investment was Rs 12 000. 5. Ganesh spends exactly half of Rs 100 000 to buy a certain number of Rs 25 shares in a company that pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share. He decides to deposit the remaining amount in a financial institute which pays an annual interest rate of 12%. Show with reasons, which of the two investments is more advantageous. We learnt earlier that only listed companies are able to trade their shares in the stock market. Let us consider the following note to learn about the trading of shares that is done after a listed company has issued new shares to the public. Nethmi Limited Company which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 per share, issued 100 000 shares to the public at Rs 10 per share at its initial offering. In a year, the value of these shares had increased in the stock market to Rs 20 per share, at which time Nadeesha bought 1000 shares. A few years later, when the price of a share in this company had increased to Rs 28, Nadeesha sold her 1000 shares. The primary market is where investors buy new shares issued by a company. Shares can only be bought in the primary market, and the purchases are done directly from the issuing company at the initial price stated by the company itself. However, subsequent to the original issuance of shares in the primary market, trading of shares can be done by investors in the secondary market. The price of a share in the secondary market is called the market price. The market price of a share varies with time depending on the demand. In the above example, the price of a share in Nethmi Limited Company increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20 in a year and subsequently after several years to Rs 28. Such increases and decreases in the price of a share occur in the secondary market, where investors are able to trade their shares. The price at which a share is bought in a company at the initial offering or later at the market price is called the purchase price of the share and the market price at which it is sold is called the selling price of the share.  (i) Find the number of shares Mahela owns in this company.  (ii) Find the amount Mahela invested to buy shares in this company. if the selling price > purchase price, then he makes a capital gain and the capital gain = selling price – purchase price. if the selling price < purchase price, then the investor incurs a capital loss and the capital loss = purchase price – selling price. Example 1 Mr. Perera who invests in the stock market, bought 2000 shares in a certain company when the market price of a share was Rs 20. When the market price of a share increased to Rs 25, he sold all his shares. (i) Find the amount Mr. Perera invested in the company. (ii) Find the amount he made by selling the shares. (iii) Find his capital gain.

On the same coordinate plane, draw the graphs of the following straight lines by calculating the y values corresponding to three selected values of x.  (i) y = x + 1  3. The graphs of four straight lines on a coordinate plane are given below. From the seven given pairs of coordinates, select the ones which correspond to the points P , Q, R and S, which are the intersecting points of the graphs. Give reasons for your answers.    • find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically,  • sketch the graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c,  • analyze the behaviour of a function by considering its graph. You have learnt in previous grades how to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations using algebraic methods. We will now consider how the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations is found by representing the equations graphically.  y – x = – 3 y + 3x = 5  y – x = – 3  y + 3x = 5 1 2  ... 4x = 8  ... x = 2 By substituting x = 2 in 1 we obtain, y – x = – 3    ... y = – 3 + 2  ... y = – 1 When these two equations are considered separately, they can be written as y = x – 3 and y = – 3x + 5 by making y the subject. Let us first draw the graphs of these straight lines on the same coordinate plane. Two tables of values corresponding to these equations are given below. x y  1 – 2 2 – 1 3 0 x y 1 2 2 3 – 1 – 4                               The graphs of the straight lines drawn on the same coordinate plane using the above tables of values intersect each other at the point (2, – 1). When the x and y values corresponding this point are substituted into the given pair of equations, it can be observed that the two sides of the equations are equal. That is, the coordinates x = 2 and y = – 1 of the intersection point of these graphs is the solution to the given pair of simultaneous equations. 0 –1 This geometric solution to the pair of simultaneous equations is further established by the fact that the same solution was obtained algebraically too. Accordingly, to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically, the straight lines corresponding to the pair of equations should be drawn on the same coordinate plane, and the coordinates of the point of intersection of the graphs should be found. Then the x and y values of the solution are obtained from the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate respectively of the point of intersection. In the following example, the method of constructing a pair of simultaneous equations and solving it graphically is considered. A person buys 10 stamps, some of value Rs 10 and the rest of value Rs 20. The total value of the stamps is Rs 120.  (i) By taking the number of stamps of value Rs 10 that he bought as x and the number of stamps of value Rs 20 as y, construct a pair of simultaneous equations.  x + y = 10 10x + 20y = 120 1 2     x y 2 5 4 4 6 3 Let us represent each of the equations graphically.  x + y = 10; that is, y = – x + 10 4 6 2 8 6 4 x  
y When equations x + y = 10 and 10x + 20y = 120 are represented they intersect each other at the point (8, 2). Therefore, the solution to the pair of equations is x = 8 and y = 2. That is, the person bought eight Rs 10 stamps and two Rs 20 stamps. Exercise 12.1 1. Solve each of the following pairs of simultaneous equations graphically. Verify 2. A certain school has two Grade 11 classes A and B. If five students from class A move to class B, then the number of students in class B will be twice the number of students in class A. However, if five students from class B move to class A, then the number of students in the two classes will be equal.  (ii) Draw the graphs of the pair of equations on the same coordinate plane and hence find the number of students in class A and in class B separately. your answers by solving the equations algebraically too.  a. y – x = 4  y – 2x = 3  b. y = – 2x – 2  – 2y = – x – 6  c. 3x – 4y = 7  5x + 2y = 3  Do the following exercise to recall what you have learnt in Grade 10 regarding the graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 and y = ax2 + b. x y – 3  4 2 0 – 2 – 1 ___ – 4 – 5 ___ – 1 3 4  a.

(vii) Obtain an approximate value for 2, to the first decimal place. Let us first consider how we can use the knowledge we have gained on the characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + b to study the characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c. Drawing graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a > 0 and identifying their characteristics To identify some basic characteristics, let us first draw the graph of the function y = x2 – 2x – 3. To do this, let us prepare a table as follows to obtain the values of y corresponding to the values of x for – 2 < x < 4. x x2 – 2x – 3 y – 2 4 4 – 3 5 – 1 1 2 – 3 0 (– 1, 0) 0 0 0 – 3 – 3 (0, – 3) 1 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 (1, – 4) 2 4 – 4 – 3 – 3 (2, – 3) 3 9 – 6 – 3 0 (3, 0) 4 16 – 8 – 3 5 (4, 5) Before drawing the graph, it is important to consider the range of values that x and y take and prepare the coordinate plane accordingly. It is easy to draw the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 by taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale.

Therefore, the equation of the axis As the value of x increases gradually from – 2, the corresponding y value decreases gradually until it attains its minimum value – 4 and then starts increasing again. Let us describe the behaviour of y further for the given range of values of x. • As the value of x increases from – 2 to – 1, the value of y, that is, the value of the function decreases positively from 5 to 0. What is meant by “decreases positively” is that the function decreases while remaining positive. • The function takes the value 0 when x = – 1. • As the value of x increases from – 1 to 1, the corresponding y value decreases • The function takes the value 0 when x = 3. • As the value of x increases from 3, the value of y increases positively. By considering the above characteristics, the range of values of x for which the function is negative can be expressed in terms of inequalities as – 1 < x < 3.  0 – 1 • The value of y is positive when the value of x is less than – 1 or greater than 3. That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is x < – 1 and x > 3. This can be described as follows.  (1) If any point (a, b) lies on the graph, then the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3 is satisfied It is extremely important to keep the above two facts in mind. Clearly the point (– 1, 0) lies on the graph. Therefore, x = – 1 and y = 0 should satisfy the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3. That is, 0 = (– 1)2 – 2 (– 1) – 3. This can be verified by simplifying the right hand side. Another way of stating this is that x = – 1 is a root of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0. By the same argument it can be stated that x = 3 is also a root of this equation. That is, the roots of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0 are the x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 intersects the x- axis. This can be written more generally as follows. The x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x - axis are the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. • The minimum value of the function is obtained at the turning point of the graph. The minimum value is – 4. The coordinates of the minimum point are (1,– 4). Let us prepare a table as follows for – 4 < x < 2 to draw the graph of the function y = – x2 – 2x + 6. x – x2 – 2x + 6 y – 4 – 16  8 + 6 – 2 – 3 – 9 6 + 6 3 – 2 – 4 4 + 6 6 – 1 – 1  2 + 6 7 0 0 0 + 6 6 1 – 1 – 2 + 6 3 2 – 4 – 4 + 6 – 2 By considering the range of values of x and y, and selecting 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small division along the y axis to be two units as scale, the graph of the given function can be drawn as follows. • The graph which has a maximum value 7 is symmetric about the line x = – 1. • Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph is x = – 1. • The coordinates of the turning point are (– 1, 7). • As the value of x increases from – 4 to – 3.6, the value of y increases negatively. • The function takes the value 0 when x = – 3.6. • As the value of x increases from – 3.6 to – 1, the corresponding y value increases • The function attains its maximum value of + 7 when the value of x is – 1. • As the value of x increases from – 1 to + 1.6, the value of the function decreases • The function takes the value 0 when x = + 1.6. • As the value of x increases from + 1.6, the value of y decreases negatively. • When the value of x lies between – 3.6 and + 1.6, the value of the function is positive. That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is – 3.6 < x < + 1.6. • When the value of x is less than – 3.6 or greater than + 1.6, the function is negative. • That is, the range of values of x for which the function is negative is x < – 3.6 and  0 – 1 • The graph intersects the line y = 0 (x-axis) when x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6. Therefore, the values of x which satisfy the equation – x2 – 2x + 6 = 0, that is, the roots of this equation are x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6.

Here the quadratic function has been expressed in the special form y = + (x + b)2 + c. When it is written in this form, some of the characteristics of its graph can be inferred without drawing the graph. Several such characteristic are given in the following table.

Let us consider the function y = (x + 1)2 – 2. This is of the form y = (x + b)2 + c where b = 1 and c = – 2. To draw the graph of this function for the values of x from – 4 to + 2, let us calculate the necessary values of y as shown in the following table. x (x + 1)2 – 2 y (x, y) – 4 9 – 2 7 (– 4, 7) – 3 4 – 2 2 (– 3, 2) – 2 1 – 2 – 1 (– 2, – 1) – 1 0  – 2 – 2 (– 1, – 2) 0 1 – 2 – 1 (0, – 1) 1 4 – 2 2 (1, 2) 2 9 – 2 7 (2, 7) By taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale, the graph of the given function can be drawn as follows. Note: This graph has a minimum point. The minimum value of the function is – 2 (= c). The coordinates of the minimum point are (– 1, – 2), that is, ( – b, c). The axis of symmetry is x = – 1 (That is, x = – b). When a quadratic function has been given in the form x = + (x + b)2 – c, the graph can be sketched using the characteristics in the above table. The example given below explains how this is done. 46  0 – 1  Example 1 Sketch the graph of y = – (x – 2)2 + 3. Since the coefficient of (x – 2)2 is negative, the turning point of the graph is a maximum. The coordinates of this maximum point is (2, 3). The axis of symmetry of the graph is x = 2. Further, to find the point at which the graph intersects the y-axis, let us substitute x = 0 in y = – (x – 2)2 + 3. We then obtain y = – (0 – 2)2 + 3 = – 1. Accordingly, we can sketch the graph as follows.

The function has been written in the special form y = x + (x + a) (x + b). As in the above case, when the function is given in this form, certain characteristics of the graph of the function can be inferred without sketching the graph. The following table provides several such characteristics. Equation of the function Nature of the turning point The coordinates of the maximum/ minimum point Equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph The points at which the function intersects the x-axis The point at which the function intersects the y-axis Let us consider y = – (x – 1) (x – 4). This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b) where a = – 1 and b = – 4. To draw the graph of this function, let us prepare a table of (x, y) values as follows.

When a quadratic function is given in the form y = + (x + a) (x + b), its graph can be sketched by considering the characteristics given in the table. Example 1 Sketch the graph of y = – (x + 3) (x – 1). This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b), where a = 3 and b = – 1 Since the coefficient of x2 is negative, the turning point is a maximum.

(i) Express the given information in two equations. (ii) How many of each type of coin does he have?   3. Malini and Nalini have a certain amount of money. When you add Rs 30 to the sum of the amounts Malini and Nalini have, the total amounts to Rs 175. Nalini has Rs 95 less than twice the amount Malini has. Let Rs x be the amount of money Malini has and Rs y be the amount of money Nalini has,  (i) Express the given information in two equations. (ii) How much does each person actually have?   4. ‘‘It costs Rs 65 to buy two books and a pen.You can buy one such book at the cost of two such pens.” Construct two simultaneous equations to represent this information and solve them to find the price of a book and a pen separately.  a. 6x + 2y = 1  4x – y = 3  d. 9p – 2q = 13  7p – 3q = 0  b. a + 2b = 3  2a + 3b = 4  e. 2x + 3y = 12  3x – 4y = 1  c. m – 4n = 6  3m + 2n = 4  f. 3a + 12 = 2b  13 + 2a = 3b  • construct simultaneous equations with rational coefficients, • solve simultaneous equations with rational coefficients, • solve quadratic equations by means of factoring, completing the square and We have learnt before how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have integers as coefficients. Now we will explore through an example, how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have fractions as coefficients. Kamal and Nimal have a certain amount of money. When you add 1 2 Kamal has to 1 3 has is equal to 1 6 separately.  of the amount Nimal has to get Rs 20. If 1 4 Let us take the amount Kamal has as when you add 1 2  y, you get 1 is, 1 2 3  x + 1 3  of what Kamal has, that is, Rs 1 2  x to 1 3 Similarly , since 1 4  th of what Kamal has is equal to 1 6  x = 1 6  x + 1 3  1 4  x – 1 6 When solving simultaneous equations involving fractions, it often helps to first clear the fractions and work with only integers. To clear the fractions we have to multiply each side of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators. Therefore, equation 1 is multiplied by 6 which is the the least common multiple of the denominators 2, and 3 and equation 2 is multiplied by 12 which is the least common multiple of the denominators 6 and 4.     Now instead of 1 and 2 we can solve the two equivalent equations 3 and 4 involving only integers. 3 + 4 (3x + 2y) + (3x – 2y) = 120 + 0  3x + 2y + 3x – 2y = 120 6x 120 6 = 6  x = 20  
                    
 
 
 3 20 – 2y = 0 2y = 60 ... The amount Kamal has = Rs 20  The amount Nimal has = Rs 30 Note: In this problem, once we converted the fractions into integers, we solved for the unknown x by adding the equations. Alternatively we can make one unknown the subject of one equation and substitute in the other equation to obtain the solution. We will discuss one such example now. The following steps will demonstrate how to solve simultaneous equations by substitution.  a – 1 5  a + 1 4  1 6; 6 1 2  x + 6 1 3 2 12; 12 1 4  ∴ 3x + 2y = 120  x – 12 1 6                      a = – 2 + 1  b 5  a = – 12 + 6 5 We will simplify the fractions by taking 20 as the common denominator which is the least common multiple of 4 and 5. We will substitute the value of a in equation 2 .  a + 1  1 3 4  b) + 1 4  b + 1 4  1 3  
 
 
 1 6  a – 1 5  8 20 b+ 5 20  13 b = 13 20  b = 13 20  13 Substituting b = 20 in equation 3 (here you can substitute the value of b in either equation to find a), we get  a = – 12 + 6 5 a = – 12 + 6 5  a = – 12 + 24 a = 12 Therefore the solution to the problem is a = 12 and b = 20. We can verify that the solution is correct by substituting a = 12 and b = 20 in the original equations. Let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation 1 .                          The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution. That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation 1 6  a – 1 5 Similarly, let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation 2 .  1 6  a – 1 5 = 2 – 4 = – 2 The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution.  a + 1 That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation 1 4 3 Therefore we can conclude that we have the correct answer. = 4 + 5 = 9  m + 2 3  m + 1 3  1 3  a + 1 4 Let us take:  m + 2 3  m + 1 3               As in example 1 we can either convert the fractions into integers or we can equate the fractional coefficients of a variable to solve the problem. Let us equate the coefficients of the unknown n. We can do this by multiplying equation 2 by 2  7 m = 7 6  m = 6 Let us substitute m = 6 in 1 .  m + 2  1 3 2  6 + 2  1 2 3  3 + 2 3  2 3  2 3  
 
 
 
 
 2n = – 6  n = – 3 As in the previous problem, we can verify that the solution is correct by substituting the answers in the original equations.  m + 2 3  m – 2 3  1 2  1 2 10 6  3 6  7 6 10 6  2 2 10 6  m + 2 3  m + 2 3 10 6                          = 5 – 1  = 4  m + 1 3 Left hand side = 5 6  m + 2 3  m + 2 3 Left hand side = 1 2  = 1 2  = 3 – 2  = 1

(ii) Solving the equations find the area of land owned by each person.                       You have learnt how to find the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 Let us review a few a such examples. Example1  Find the roots of the quadratic equation x2 – 5x + 6 = 0.  (x – 2) (x – 3) = 0 (by factoring)  Then either x – 2 = 0 or x – 3 = 0. Therefore x = 2 or x = 3 Find the roots of 2x2 + 3x – 9 = 0  2x2 + 6x – 3x – 9 = 0  2x (x + 3) – 3 (x + 3) = 0 Here we cannot see the quadratic equation immediately. But when we clear the fractions, it can be set up as a quadratic equation. For this, we will consider the common denominator of the left hand side.(You can also do this by multiplying the whole equation by the least common multiple of 2x – 1 and 3x + 2)  3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1)  (2x – 1) (3x + 2) 3 2x – 1 2 3x + 2          3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1) = (2x – 1) (3x + 2) (cross multiplying)  9x + 6 – 4x + 2 = 6x2 + 4x – 3x – 2 (expanding the factors)  6x2 – 4x – 10 = 0 (simplifying)  3x2 – 2x – 5 = 0 (dividing the whole equation by 2)  3x2 – 5x + 3x – 5 = 0  x (3x – 5) + 1 (3x – 5) = 0  (3x – 5) (x + 1) = 0  ... 3x – 5 = 0 or x + 1 = 0  or x = – 1  ... x =  ... x = 1  ... x = 1 Let us see how we can set up a quadratic equation to solve this problem. Of the two consecutive integers, let us take x to be the smaller integer. Then the other integer is x + 1. Therefore the consecutive integers can be written as x, (x + 1) . Since the product of the two numbers is 12 we get,  x (x + 1) = 12.  ... x2 + x – 12 = 0  (x – 3) (x + 4) = 0. This is, x – 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0.  ... x = 3 and x = – 4 are the solutions of the above equation. If we take x = 3 then the consecutive number is (x + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4. If we take x = – 4 the consecutive number is (x + 1) = – 4 + 1 = – 3. Therefore there are two pairs of consecutive numbers whose product will be 12. They are 3, 4 and – 4, – 3. We can verify the answer by substituting the two pairs of values in the quadratic equation x2 + x – 12 = 0.     If we substitute x = 3 on the left hand side of x2 + x – 12 = 0,  LHS = x2 + x – 12  = 32 + 3 – 12  = 9 + 3 – 12  = 12 – 12  = 0  ... LHS = RHS If we substitute x = – 4 on the left hand side,  LHS = x2 + x – 12      = (– 4)2 + (– 4) – 12  = 16 – 4 – 12  = 16 – 16  = 0 ... LHS = RHS The area of a rectangular plot of land is 150 square metres. The length of the plot is 5 metres more than the width. Let x be the width of the plot.  (i) Write the length of the plot in terms of x.  (ii) Set up a quadratic equation in x to represent the area of the plot x. (iii) Solve the equation to find the length and the width of the plot.  (i) Length = x + 5. (ii) The given data can be shown more clearly by aid of a drawing.  x (x + 5) = 150 This is the required equation. (iii) Let us solve the above equation.   x2 + 5x – 150 = 0  (x – 10) (x + 15) = 0                                     ... x – 10 = 0 or x + 15 = 0  ... x = + 10 or x = – 15 The roots of the quadratic equation are x = + 10 and x = – 15. But since a length cannot be negative, the only acceptable answer is x = 10. Therefore the width of the rectangular plot = 10 m The length of the rectangular plot = 15 m  We can verify the answer by substituting x = 10 in the quadratic equation x2 + 5x – 150 = 0.  = 10 (10 + 5)  = 10 15  = 150 ... LHS = RHS  (b) 3 4  (e) x2 2 3 x +1  (h) 4 x 3 x +1 = 3                  6. A playing field measuring, 32 metres by 20 metres has a pathway outside the field all around it, of uniform width. The area of the pathway is 285 square metres. 7. The hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is 2x + 1 cm. The lengths of the other two sides are x cm and x + 7 cm respectively. Solve for x and find the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. We have seen how to solve a quadratic equation by factorization. This method is useful only when the factorization is easy to do. Many quadratic expressions, such as x2 + 3x + 5 = 0 and 2x2 – 5x –1 = 0 cannot be factorized easily.To solve such quadratic equations we have to use alternative methods.One such method is to arrange the quadratic as a perfect square. This is known as solving the quadratic equation by completing the square. Before we proceed, let us recall how we learnt to write an expression of the form x2 + bx as a perfect square. Activity Write the constant you should include to convert each of the following expressions into a perfect square and write it as a perfect square. a. x2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)2 b. x2 + 8x + ... = ............ c. x2 – 14x + ... = ............ d. x2 + 3x + ... = ............ e. (x + ...)2 = x2 + 8x + ... f. (x + ...)2 = x2 + 2ax + ... g. (x + b)2 = x2 + ...x + b2    h. (x + m)2 = x2 + ...x + m2 First we will complete the square of a quadratic equation which can also be solved by factoring. Example 1 Solve x2 + 2x – 3 = 0 by completing the square. First we will keep all terms containing x on one side and move the constant to the right. Then we get  x2 + 2x – 3 = 0  x2 + 2x = 3 To write the left hand side as a perfect square, take half of the x-term coefficient and square it and add this value to both sides. That is, in this problem we have to add +1 to both sides.  x2 + 2x + 1 = 3 + 1  (x + 1)2 = 4 Take the square root of both sides. We have to allow for both positive and negative values. Then x = + 2 – 1 or x = – 2 – 1  x = 1 or x = – 3 Therefore the solutions to the above equation are x = 1 and x = – 3.  x2 – 4x + 1 = 0  x2 – 4x – 1  x2 – 4x + 4 = – 1 + 4  (x – 2)2 = 3  x – 2 = + 3 ^taking the square root of both sides)       x = 2 + 3  x = 2 + 3 or x = 2 – 3.  Suppose it is given that 3 is approximately 1.73  Then x = 2 + 1.73 or x = 2 – 1.73                     Then the solutions of this equation are x = 3.73 and x = 0.27. Example 3 Here it is easy if we first divide all the terms by 2 to make the leading coefficient (coefficient of the x2 term) one. 4.36 – 3 2  x = 0.68 or x = – 3.68 The roots of the equation are x = 0.68 and x = – 3.68.   (Take 2 = 1.41, 3 = 1.73, 5 = 2.23, 6 = 2.44, 13= 3.6, 17 = 4.12 and 57 = 7.54) – 19 – 3  2  2 Suppose 4.36 is given as an approximate value of 19 . +19 4  x + 3 2  = + 19 2 2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0  x2 + 3x – +10 + 9 4                   (d) x2 + 4x – 8 = 0  (g) 2x2 + 5x = 4 An easy method of solving a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is by using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is derived by completing the square on a general quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. Once the quadratic formula is derived, it is no longer necessary to use the process of completing the square to solve "each" quadratic equation. a ^writing the left hand side as a perfect square and arranging the terms on the right hand  ax2 + bx = – c ax2 a + bx a = – c a ^ dividing by a& a x = – c  x2 + b a 2b 2a = – c a + b b2 4a2 – c 2a 2b

The figure illustrates the line segment AB. The point C lies on AB such that AC = 2 cm and CB = 3 cm. Point C divides AB into two line segments AC and CB. Then, the ratio of AC to CB can be written using their lengths as follows.  AC : CB = 2 : 3  AC : AB = 2 : 5  CB : AC = 3 : 2  CB : AB = 3 : 5.  Similarly  hence     The ratio of the lengths of line segments should be written in the order of the line segments relevant to that ratio. 1 cm Q • understand the meaning of equiangular and similar figures, • identify the theorem “A line drawn parallel to a side of a triangle, divides the other two sides proportionally”, identify the converse theorem “If a straight line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally then that line is parallel to the remaining side”, identify the theorem “Corresponding sides of equiangular triangles are proportional”, identify the converse theorem “If the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional then those triangles are equiangular”.

That is, since BC//DE, AD : DB = AE : EC. Let us understand the converse of this theorem by considering the triangle PQR shown in the figure. Here the line AB intersects the sides PQ and PR. The ratios of the line segments of each side are PA : AQ and PB : BR. If these two ratios are equal, that is, if PA : AQ = PB : BR then the line AB, which intersects those two sides at P and Q, is parallel to the other side QR. This is the converse of the theorem we have already learnt in this lesson. This result can be stated as a theorem. Given below are some examples with calculations and proved riders related to the theorem. The converse of the above theorem: If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then that line is parallel to the other side.                                                                          AE : EC = 6 : 4.5 = 4 : 3.  ... AD : DB = AE : EC  ... The line DE divides AB and AC proportionally.  ... By the converse of the theorem, DE//BC.   But AD : DB = 4 : 3 Hence AX : XF = 4 : 3 C The point P lies on the side AB of the quadrilateral ABCD. The line drawn through P, parallel to AC, meets BC at Q. Similarly, the line drawn through P, parallel to AD, meets BD at R. Prove that RQ//DC.          2. In triangle ABC, the point P lies on the side AB and the point Q lies on the side  = 180x . 4. In the quadrilateral ABCD given in the figure, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at K. If AK = 4.8 cm,  KC = 3.2 cm, BK = 3 cm and KD = 2 cm, then show that DC is parallel to AB.(Hint: In triangle KDC, take  that the points A and B lie on DK and CK produced                                                           In day to day language we say that these three triangles are of the "same shape". The following figure illustrates three quadrilaterals and three pentagons of the same shape. But the following pair of triangles as well as pair of quadrilaterals are not of the same shape. Did you think of what is meant by "shape" here? In mathematics things should be defined precisely. It is necessary to give a precise definition for —shape˜. —Similar figure˜ is the phrase in mathematics equivalent to —same shape˜ in day to day language. Here we consider only the similarity of polygons. 5. In the triangle ABC given in the figure, the midpoint of the side BC is D. The point O lies on AD. BO produced intersects AC at P and CO produced intersects AB at Q. The line AD is produced to R such that OD = DR. Prove that,  (i) BRCO is a parallelogram.  (ii) AQ : QB = AO : OR.  (iii) QP//BC.     1. the angles of one polygon are equal to the angles of the other and, 2. the corresponding sides of the polygons are proportional. , B BC QR = , C CD RS = , D DA SP , AB PQ = In this lesson we hope to study more about similar triangles. In the two triangles ABC and PQR given below,  = P AB PQ =  = Q BC QR = C  = R CA RP , then by definition the two triangles are similar.  There is an important result related to the similarity of triangles. That is, if the angles of one triangle are equal to the angles of another triangle, then those two triangles are similar. In otherwords, if three angles of a triangle are equal to the three angles of another triangle then the corresponding sides of those two triangles are proportional. Therefore to find out whether two triangles are similar, it is sufficient to check only the angles of the two triangles. As an example, in the above two AB PQ = BC QR = CA RP '       This result is not true for polygons which are not triangles. For example, in the following two quadrilaterals, the angles of one quadrilateral are equal to the angles of the other quadrilateral. Each of these angles is 90x. However one of the quadrilaterals is a rectangle and the other is a square. Therefore their sides are not proportional and hence the two quadrilaterals are not similar. If the angles of two polygons are equal, then those polygons are said to be equiangular. According to the above discussion, two equiangular triangles are similar too. Let us use this result as a theorem without proof. ² Using the protractor, draw two different sized triangles, each with interior angles x, 50x and 90x . As shown below, name the triangles as ABC and PQR . According to the above activity, you can understand that if two triangles are equiangular then they are similar. AB PQ , BC QR and CA RP separately.  Theorem on equiangular triangles: If two triangles are equiangular then the corresponding sides are proportional.   Note: 1.If restricted to triangles, similar and equi-angular mean the same thing. 2.It is clear that two congruent triangles are similar. But two similar triangles may  not be congruent. 3. If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then the remaining pair of angles are also equal to each other. The reason for this is because the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180x. Therefore, if two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then they are equiangular. Example 1 In the two triangles ABC and PQR in the figure, A of x and y in the triangle PQR.  and B  = R P  = R ... C ... The triangles ABC and PQR are equiangular. ...

(i) Show that the triangles ABC and APQ are equiangular.  (ii) Find the values of x and y .                5 cm 40x 4 cm S    Next we investigate the converse of the above theorem. That is, to find whether the statement "if the sides of two triangles are proportional then those triangles are equiangular" is true .This converse is true and we can state this result as a theorem. Also, if the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides of another triangle then the two triangles are said to be similar. ² Construct the triangle ABC with AB = 2.5 cm, BC = 3 cm and AC = 3.5 cm. ² Construct the triangle PQR with PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and PR = 7 cm. hrough this activity you may have observed that the corresponding sides of the two triangles are proportional and also that the angles of ABC are equal to the angles of PQR. This result can be expressed as the converse theorem of the theorem which we learnt about equiangular triangles earlier. AB PQ , BC QR , AC PR ' ² Measure the angles of each triangles separately. ² What type of triangles are ABC and PQR?

According to the lengths of the sides given in the figure, show with reasons that the triangles ABC and PQR are equiangular. Name the equal angles. PQ AB = RQ CA = PR BC = Since these ratios are equal, according to the converse theorem, the triangles PQR and ABC are equiangular.

In triangle ABC, PQ drawn parallel to BC meets the side AB at P and the side AC at Q. The lines CP and BQ intersect each other at S. SR drawn parallel to AB meets BC at R. BR RC = AQ AC '   Data Representation and Interpretation We know that the range is the value which is obtained by subtracting the least value of the data from the highest value of the data. Therefore, To facilitate interpretation, a group of data is often represented as a frequency distribution. We know that if the range of the data is large, then the data is divided into class intervals. Such a frequency distribution is called a grouped frequency distrbution. In such frequency distributions, generally, the number of class intervals should be between 5 and 10. The size of a class interval is determined by dividing the range of the frequency distribution by the number of class intervals and taking the least integer greater than that value . For example let us group the above data into 6 class intervals. To find the size of a class interval, first divide 28 (the range) by 6 (number of class intervals). 28  6 4.66 ' Hence the size of each interval should be 5, which is the least integer greater than 4.66. 100 By studying this lesson, you will be able to  ² find the limits and boundaries of the intervals of a frequency distribution  ² draw the relevant histogram  ² draw the relevant frequency polygon  ² draw the relevant cumulative frequency curve and find the inter quartile              Next the first class interval needs to be selected. Since the lowest value of the data is 130, the first class interval should start from 130. The following are two different grouped frequency distributions from the given data. 130 -135 135 - 140 140 - 145 145 - 150 150 - 155 155 - 160 3 7 10 5 3 2 130 -134 135 - 139 140 - 144 145 - 149 150 - 154 155 - 159 3 7 10 5 3 2 Consider the first grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 135 class interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than 135. The second class interval 135 - 140 represents the heights greater than or equal to 135 and less than 140. The other class intervals can be described similarly. Now consider the second grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 134 class interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than or equal to 134. Let us observe another difference between these two distributions. In the first distribution there are no gaps between the class intervals. For example, the class interval 135 - 140 starts from the upper limit 135 of the previous class interval 130 - 135. So there is a common limit for these class intervals. But this is not so in the second distribution. For example 134 is the upper limit of the class interval 130-134, but the next class interval starts from 135. The gap between these two limits is 1. In the next section of this lesson we hope to learn how to draw histograms. To draw a histogram, there should not be these kinds of gaps. Therefore we must change the second distribution appropriately. This change can be done by introducing a common boundary for the class intervals. That common boundary can be determined easily. For example, in the second distribution, 134.5 is taken as the boundary of the class intervals 130 - 134 and 135 - 139, which is the exact middle of the upper limit (134) of the class interval 130 - 134 and the lower limit (135) of the class interval 135 - 139.The new distribution constructed in this way is given below.     129.5 - 134.5 134.5 - 139.5 139.5 - 144.5 144.5 - 149.5 149.5 - 154.5 154.5 - 159.5 3 7 10 5 3 2 Here observe that, 0.5 is subtracted from the lower limits and 0.5 is added to the upper limits of every class interval of the original distribution.This rule is valid for the first and last class intervals too. The values 129.5 and 159.5 are obtained in that way. Also observe that, the size of the class interval of this new distribution is 5. In the above, the first kind of distribution is simple. But practically, the second kind of distribution can be constructed easily. Both kinds of distributions can be found in statistics. Let us consider how to draw the histogram of a grouped frequency distribution. A histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution. In a histogram, the frequencies of class intervals are represented by the heights of the rectangular columns which touch each other. Let us consider first, how to draw the histogram if the sizes of the class intervals are equal.(As in the example in the previous section). When drawing the histogram, follow the steps given below. ² Mark the boundaries of the calss intervals on the horizontal axis drawn to an appropriate scale.  Along the vertical axis, on an appropriate scale, draw the columns such that the height of the column on a class interval is the corresponding frequency. Draw the histogram of the grouped frequency distribution prepared in the previous section.                  129.5 - 134.5 134.5 - 139.5 139.5 - 144.5 144.5 - 149.5 149.5 - 154.5 154.5 - 159.5 The relevant histogram is given below. Two small squares along the horizontal axis represents 1 centimetre. Five small squares along the vertical axis represents two children. Note: Since the data starts from 129.5, it is not necessary to show the class intervals from 0 to 129.5 in the histogram. The mark at the beginning of the x axis indicates that the axis has been shrunk in this region. The following is a frequency distribution of the Mathematics marks of students taken from a School Based Assessment.   Class intervals (Marks Obtained) Frequency (Number of children) As an example, the interval 0 - 10 represents the marks greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10. The other class intervals are defined similarly. Draw the histogram of the frequency distribution. In this frequency distribution, the first class interval ends at 10 and next class interval starts at 10.This histogram can be drawn easily. Now let us consider how to draw a histogram of a frequency distribution with different sized class intervals. A frequency distribution based on the marks of 40 students in a term test is given below. Class intervals (Marks Obtained) Frequency (Number of students) If you observe the class intervals, you can see that the sizes of the class intervals are not the same. The size of each of the first 5 class intervals is 10 and the sizes of the next two class intervals are 20 and 30 respectively. Another important feature in a histogram is that the areas of the columns are proportional to the relevant frequencies. 104  Therefore if the sizes of the class intervals are equal, then the frequencies are proportional to the heights of the columns. Hence in the above examples 1 and 2, the frequency can be identified directly with the height of the column. But in this example, since the sizes of the class intervals are not the same, the frequency cannot be identified directly with the height of the column. The heights of the columns should be obtained such that the areas of the columns are proportional to the frequences. This can be done as follows. In this frequency distribution, the size of all but the class intervals 50 - 70 and 70 - 100 is 10. The size of the class interval 50 - 70 is 20 and the size of the class interval 70 - 100 is 30. Hence the size of the smallest class interval is 10 and the size of the class interval 50 - 70 is two times that. Since the area of the column which represents the frequency of the class interval should be proportional to the frequency, frequency 2     The size of the class interval 70 - 100 is three times the size of the smallest class interval. ... The height the column of the 70 - 100 class interval =             1. The frequency distribution prepared from the data collected by a weather forecasting center in a certain area is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Rainfall in a week in mm. Number of weeks in the year 2015 is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Class intervals ^Number of books issued& Frequency (Number of days) 3. The frequency distribution prepared from the data obtained by measuring the circumference of teak trees in a forest plantation is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Circumference of a tree (cm) 4. The frequency distribution prepared from the data on the daily consumption of water provieded through rural water project to 60 houses is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Home usage of water (Litres) Number of houses 5. The information on the monthly electricity consumption of 75 houses in January 2015 is shown in the table given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. A frequency polygon is a graphical representation of grouped data similar to a histogram. There are two methods to construct frequency polygons. ² From the histogram of the frequency distribution ² From the mid-values and frequencies of the class intervals In the following example, let us consider first, how to construct a frequency polygon from the histogram.  (i) First draw the histogram relevant to the given information  (ii) In each column in the histogram, mark the sign — ˜ at the middle of the top of the column. (See the following figure; the signs — ˜ denoted as A, B, C, D and E ) Class intervals (Units of electricity) Frequency (Number of houses) 6. The following frequency distribution shows the information on the number of telephone calls and the time duration of each telephone call on a certain day at a communication centre. Time duration of one telephone call (seconds)       (iii) Join these — ˜signs by the line segments as shown in the figure. (iv) On the horizontal axis, mark half the length of the class interval to the right of the last class interval and to the left of the first class interval (hence 5 units)' Join E F and A G. Now you get the polygon ABCDEFG. This polygon is called the frequency polygon of the frequency distribution. If you observe carefully, you can see that the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of the columns of the histogram. To draw a frequency polygon, it is not necessary to draw the histogram first. The frequency polygon can be drawn directly by using the mid-values of the class intervals and using the relevant frequencies. The following example shows how to draw the frequency polygon using this method. From the given frequency distribution, prepare a table with the mid-values of the class intervals to draw the frequency polygon. Class interval 0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 Mid-value 5 15 25 35 45 Mark the mid-values of the class intervals along the horizontal axis and mark the frequencies along the vertical axis. Then mark the corresponding points. The frequency polygon can be obtained by joining those points respectively by line segments. 108 Let us consider next, how to draw a frequency polygon with unequal sized class intervals. Class intervals (Obtained marks) Frequency (Number of students) Let us draw the frequency polygon for the above frequency distribution with unequal sized class intervals. 50 60 Marks Here, the class interval 50 - 60 of size 20 is divided in to two class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Similarly the class interval 70 - 100 of size 30 is divided in  to three class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Also in this case, observe that the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of columns of the histogram. 1. The frequency distribution prepared from the data collected by measuring the masses of students who attended a medical clinic of a school is given below. Mass of a student (kg) Number of students  (i) Illustrate this information in a histogram.  (ii) Draw the frequency polygon on this histogram. 2. The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the data collected through a test conducted to determine the life time of bulbs manufactured by a company. Class intervals (No. of hours the bulb lighted) Frequency (Number of bulbs)  (i) Illustrate this information in a histogram.  (ii) Draw the frequency polygon on this histogram. Mass (kg) Number of members  (i) From this information prepare a table with the mid-values of the class intervals.  (ii) Draw the frequency polygon using the mid-values of the class intervals. This is a another method of representing data of a frequency distribution graphically. Let us see how to draw the cumulative frequency curve by considering the following example Example 1 The following is a frequency distribution of the marks in Mathematics of 32 students in a class. Let us draw its cumulative frequency curve. Class intervals (Marks) Frequency (Number of students) 5. The table given below is prepared from the information of a communication centre on the number of telephone calls taken on a certain day and the time duration of those calls. Time duration of one telephone call (seconds)  (i) Draw the histogram of this frequency distribution.  (ii) Use this histogram to draw the frequency polygon. 15.3 Cumulative frequency curve of a grouped frequency  distribution  frequency 4 10 20 29 32 0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 The word "cumulative" means "increasing by addition". For example, in the above table, the cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 20-30 is the sum of all frequencies less than in the intervals up to the class mark 30. (In other words no. of students whose marks are less than 30) That is equal to 20. The cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 40 - 50 is the number of students whose marks are less than 50. That is 32, the total number of students. After completing this table, to draw the cumulative frequency curve, all the points corresponding to the upper limit of each class interval via the relevant cumulative frequency should be marked. These points should be joined smoothly, as shown below. 40 Upper limit of class intervals In previous sections, we learnt how to construct a histogram, frequency polygon and cumulative frequency curve from a group of data. These are useful to get an idea about how far the data disperses centrally. For example, just by looking at the histogram, the modal class of a grouped frequency distribution can be decided. Similarly, an idea on how far the data disperses symmetrically can also be obtained. In this section, we hope to learn about quartiles and the interquartile range of a group of data. From this we can get some idea about the dispersion of data. 112 The first thing to do to find quartiles and the interquartile range is to organize the data in ascending order. After that the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2) and the third quartile (Q3) can be found as follows. Find the median of the data to the left of the second quartile. This is the first quartile. Find the median of the data to the right of the second quartile. This is the third quartile. The median of that part is 11. That is also in the square. At last, consider the data right of the median. ' The median of that part is 20. That is also in a square. Hence, first quartile = Q1 = 11 second quartile = Q2= 14 third quartile = Q3= 20.  8 + 11 2 The median of that is 6. It is in the square. Hence Q1= 6. The median of that is 15. It is in the square. Hence Q3= 15.  There are 16 data in the following data string. Observe how to calculate the quartiles which are indicated by the heads of arrows.  25 + 26 2  30 + 30 2  35 + 37 2 In statistics, there are several methods to find quartiles of a data string. The method described here is the most practical and the most convenient method. Another method to calculate quartiles is, finding the locations of the quartiles using the formulae  1 4  2 4  3 4 Q3 is located at the place As another example, consider the data string 9 12 18 20 21 23 24 26. In this data string, according to the formulae,  105 + 107  105 + 107 2 2 = = 106 106  115 + 119 2 115 + 119  2 = = 117 117           1 4  2 4  3 4  = 2. 25. Hence Q1 = 12 + 1 4  = 4.5. Hence Q2 = 20 + 21  = 6.75. Hence Q3 = 23 + 3 4 Here, when using different methods from each other, different answers with small deviations may be obtained. But this is not a problem since in methods of statistics it is expected to get approximate values. The interquartile range of a group of data is the value obtained by subtracting the first quartile from the third quartile.  (i) Median  (ii) First quartile (iii) Third quartile (iv) Interquartile range.  (i) Median  (ii) First quartile (iii) Third quartile (iv) Interquartile range.                       In this section, we hope to learn how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped data. Here we describe only, how to find it using the cumulative frequency curve. Let us consider how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped data from the following example. The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the Mathematics marks of a group of students in grade 11. Let us draw the cumulative frequency curve for this frequency distribution. 16 24 34 43 48 52  0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 60 60 - 70 70 - 80  (i) Median  (ii) First quartile (iii) Third quartile (iv) Interquartile range.         40 (0, 39) 35 30 (0, 26) 25 15 (0, 13) 10 30 20 (26, 0) 50 60 40 (42, 0) (55, 0) Now let us pay attention to the vertical lines and the horizontal lines in the above figure of the cumulative frequency curve. Here the total number of data is 52. That is, the sum of the frequencies is 52. Let us first find, the locations of the first, second and third quartiles of those 52 data. Note: When finding the quartiles from the cumulative frequency curve, there is no need to do it as in setion 15.5. Since the number of data is large (More than 30 data values is considered as a large number of data), it is sufficient to locate the positions of 1  of the frequencies. 4  of the frequencies and 3 4  of the frequencies, 1 2 When the cumulative frequency is increasing then the first quartile is located at the position of 1 4  1 4  1 2  3 4 Now it is needed to find the data corresponding to the points 13, 26 and 39 (frequencies) > > > > > > of the vertical axis. The necessary lines are illustrated in the figure. As an example the first quartile can be found as follows. Since the first quartile is located at the 13th position, a horizontal line is drawn from the point 13 on the vertical axis until it meets the curve. From the point that line meets the curve, a vertical line is drawn until it meets the horizontal axis. The value of that point on the horizontal axis is the first quartile. If we find the quartiles for the given example, then we get Q1 = 26, Q2 = 42 and Q3 = 55' Hence, the interquartile range = Q3 – Q1 = 55 – 26 = 29. As an example, if the total frequency of a frequency distribution is 51 then the first, the second and the third quartiles are in the  1 4  1 2  3 4 Hence the quartiles can be found by considering the values on the x-axis corresponding to the values 12.75, 25.5 and 38.25 (or the appropriate values rounded to the scale of the graph) on the vertical axis.

Given below is an arithmetic progression. In this sequence, by adding the constant value 2 to any term, the term next to it is obtained. We called this constant value the common difference of the arithmetic progression. In this sequence, the first term is 3. The second term is obtained by multiplying the first term by 2, third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 2. The sequence continues in this manner, where, each term multiplied by 2 is the next term. In other words, if we divide any term other than the first term, by the previous term we get the constant value 2. A sequence that yields a fixed value when any term, other than the first term, is divided by the previous term is called a geometric progression. The fixed value, by which each term is multiplied to obtain the next term, is called the common ratio of the geometric progression. The common ratio of the above geometric progression is 2. Given a number sequence, one can check whether it is a geometric progression by doing the following test. Note down the value obtained by dividing the second term by the first term. Similarly, note down the values obtained by dividing the third term by the second term, fourth term by the third term and so forth. If the values noted down are all equal, then it is a geometric progression. When the noted values are all equal, this common value is the common ratio. 122  ² identify whether a given number sequence is a geometric progression,  ² use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression,  ² use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression     6 2 18 6 54 18 54 18  = 18 6  ...  ... The given sequence is a geometric progression. Moreover, the common ratio is 3. 20 50  50 100  100 200 Check whether the number sequence 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80, ... is a geometric progression. The terms 4, x, 16 are consecutive terms of a geometric progression. What is the value of x?  = 16 x x by solving this equation.  –10  5  ... –10  5  
 = 20 –10  20 –10  = – 40 20 – 40 20  80 – 40  80 – 40 = – 2   Let us check for each of the values we have obtained, whether the three terms 4, x, 16 are in a geometric progression. hen x = 8" the sequence 4, 8, 16 is a geometric progression with common ratio 2. When x = – 8" the sequence 4, – 8, 16 is a geometric progression with a common ratio – 2. Recall that you learnt, in Grade 10, that the nth term of an arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d is Tn = a + (n – 1) d. Let us now consider how we can obtain an expression for the nth term of a geometric progression. We will write —a˜ for the first term of the geometric progression and —r˜ for the common ratio. Moreover, we will denote the nth term of the sequence by Tn . Consider the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, 54, ... . Here, the first term (a) is 2 and the common ratio (r) is 3' T1 = 2 = 2 1 = 2 31 – 1 T2 = 6 = 2 3 = 2 32 – 1 T3 = 18 = 2 3 3 = 2 33 – 1 T4 = 54 = 2 3 3 3 = 2 34 – 1 The above expressions can be written in terms of the first term (a) and the common ratio (r), as If x  = 16 x 4 Thus ... (x – 8) (x + 8) = 0 ... x = 8 or x = – 8     T1 = 2 30 = a r1 – 1 T2 = 2 31 = a r2 – 1 T3 = 2 32 = a r3 – 1 T4 = 2 33 = a r4 – 1 According to the observable pattern, the nth term Tn can be written as Tn = ar n – 1' The nth term of the geometric progression with first term a and common ratio r is given by Find the 5th term of the geometric progression with first term 3 and common ratio 2.  a = 3, r = 2, n = 5 Tn = ar n – 1 T5 = 3 25 – 1  = 3 24  = 3 16  = 48 Therefore, the 5th term is 48'      T7 = 81 1 3  = 81 1 3  = 81 1 729  
 
 
a = 81 27 81  Tn = ar n – 1  ... T5 = 81 1 3  = 81 1 3  1 81 Thus, the fifth term is 1 and the seventh term is 1 9 = 81 = 1  
 
 
 
   
 
 
         
 
    
 
    
         
        Exercise 16.2 1. Find the 6th term of the geometric progression with first term 5 and common When all but one from the first term (a)" common ratio (r), nth term Tn and n, of a geometric progression are given, the unknown value can be found by substituting the given values into Tn = ar n – 1' consider at the following examples' Find the first term of the geometric progression with common ratio 3 and 4th term 54' r = 3, n = 4, Tn = 54  Tn = ar n – 1   ... T4 = a (3)4 – 1  ... 54  = a (3)3  ... 54 = a 27 54  ... a = 27  = 2 The first term of the sequence is 2'           
 
 
 
Find the common ratio of the geometric progression with first term 5 and 7th term 320, and list the first five terms. There are two values for the common ratio. Hence, there are two geometric progressions satisfying the given conditions.  First five terms of the progression with r  First five terms of the progression with r  = 2 are 5, 10, 20, 40, 80'  = – 2 are 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80' Which term is ratio 1 ? 4  ... 320  ... r 6  Tn = ar (n – 1) T7 = 5 (r)7 – 1  = 5 (r)6 320  =  5  = 64  = (+2)6 or (–2)6  = 2 or – 2   
 
 1 4  = 1  1 46 4  = 1  1 4 4  (n – 1) = 6  n = 6 + 1  = 7 ... it is the 7th term that is equal to 64 64 4 = 64 1 4 1            The first term of a geometric progression, is 160 and the 6th term is 1215. Find the common ratio of the progression. Similarly, when any two terms of a geometric progression are given, Tn = ar n – 1 can be used to find the first term and the common ratio. Consider the following example. Find the common ratio and the first term of the geometric progression with 3rd term 48 and 6th term 3072. Tn = ar n – 1 T3 = ar (3 – 1)  = 48  ar 2  T6 = ar (6 – 1)  ar 5  = 3072 35 25  = 3 2  = 1 ... The common ratio is 1   160r 5  ... r 5 1215 = 160 (r)6 – 1  = 1215 1215 160 243 32  
           Both unknowns, a and r, appear in both equations 1 and 2. We can easily remove a from these two by dividing the equations. 3072 48 ar 5 ar 2 =  r 3  = 64  r 3  = 43  r = 4  
 
 = 48  a (4)2 = 48  16 a = 48 48  a = 16  a = 3 First term of the progression = 3  Common ratio = 4  
 
 
 
 
The 6th term of a geometric progression is – 8 and the 10th term of the same progression is – 128.  (i) Show that there are two such geometric progressions. (ii) Write down the first five term of each progression.  (i) Tn = ar (n – 1) T6 = ar (6 – 1)  = – 8  ar 5     T10 = ar (10 – 1)  ar 9  = – 128 – 128 – 8 ar 9 ar 5 =  = 16  = 24 or (– 2)4  r 4  r 4  r = 2 or – 2    = – 8  a (2)5 = – 8  a 32 = – 8              First five terms of the geometric progression with r = 2 and a = –  – – 8 32  a = –  ar 5  = – 8  a (–2)5 = – 8  a (– 32) = – 8 – 8 – 32  
 
Exercise 16.3 1. Find the first term of the geometric progression with common ratio 3 and 4th term 6. The common ratio of a geometric progression is 2 and the first term is 1 32 7. Which term is equal to 35 9 common ratio 2 3        The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression with first term a and common ratio r is denoted by Sn' Let us now consider finding a formula for Sn ' T1 = a, T2 = ar, T3 = ar2, T4 = ar3, ...., Tn = ar (n – 1). Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + ...... + Tn ... Sn = a + ar + ar2 +ar3 + ............ + ar (n – 1)   We use the following technique to find a formula for Sn. First we will multiply both sides of equation 1 by r. Then we get, Now, when we subtract 1 from 2 , we get" r Sn – Sn = arn – a ^observe that many terms on the right hand side cancel& ... Sn (r –1) = a (rn –1) a (rn –1)  ... Sn = (r –1) This is an expression for Sn in terms of a, r, n. By multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the right hand side by – 1, we can also express it as a (1– rn) (1– r) 12. The 4th term of a geometric progression is 100 and the 9th term is 31 8    a (r n –1) (r –1) a (1– r n ) (1– r) Find the sum of the first five terms of the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, ..., both by finding the first five terms and adding them up, and by using the formula for Sn . Let us first find the sum by adding all five terms. We are given that T1 = 2, T2 = 6 and T3 = 18 Moreover, T4 = 18 3 = 54 and T5 = 54 3 = 162 . Therefore" S5 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5 = 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + 162 = 242 a (rn –1) (r –1)  = 3, n = 5.

We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience. The triangles ABC, PQR and KLM in the above figure are respectively an acute angled triangle, a right angled triangle and an obtuse angled triangle. These triangles have been thus named, by considering the largest (one or more) of the interior angles. Accordingly, the right angle PQR  is the largest interior angle of the triangle PQR. The side PR which is directly opposite this angle is the longest side of the triangle. This side is called the hypotenuse, and the remaining sides, namely PQ and QR, are known as the sides that include the right angle. There is evidence to show that from ancient times, man knew about the geometrical properties of triangles. The marvel of the pyramids made in Egypt around 3000 B.C. is accepted by us all. For such creations, knowledge of geometry, especially on the characteristics of triangles is essential. In the “Rhind Papyrus” of around 1650 B.C. too, the main shape that can be observed is the triangle. Using this knowledge on the geometry of triangles, in 600 B.C., the Greek mathematician Pythagoras presented a special relationship between the lengths of the sides of right angled triangles. Although there is evidence to show that this relationship was known by early civilizations in countries such as China and India, Pythagoras is considered to be the first to offer a geometrical proof of this relationship. Later on in 300 B.C., the mathematician named Euclid included this result as a theorem, together with its proof, in his historical book called THE ELEMENTS. ² identify Pythagoras’ Theorem ² use Pythagoras’ Theorem in calculations and to prove riders ² identify Pythagorean triples. A part of a floor on which tiles of the same shape and size have been placed is depicted in the above figure. The shape of each tile is an isosceles right angled triangle. Let us consider the isosceles right angled triangle PQR. The square PQAB has been drawn on the side PQ and the square RCDQ has been drawn on the side RQ (regions shaded in blue) of this triangle. The square drawn on the side PQ has an area equal to that covered by two tiles. Similarly, the square drawn on the side QR also has an area equal to that covered by two tiles, while the square PREF drawn on the hypotenuse PR has an area equal to that covered by four tiles. Accordingly, for the squares lying on the three sides of the isosceles right angled triangle PQR, it is clear that the following relationship holds. Paste the right triangular shaped lamina on a white paper. Paste the squares on the three sides of the triangle as shown in the figure given below. Using a square ruled paper, cut out 3 square shaped laminas and 1 triangular shaped lamina as follows.  (i) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 3 small squares  (ii) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 4 small squares  (iii) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 5 small squares  (iv) A right triangular shaped lamina, where the sides which include the right angle are of lengths equal to the length of 3 small squares and 4 small squares respectively.           This relationship between the sides of a right angled triangle, which was known from ancient days, can be expressed as a theorem as follows. Pythagoras’ Theorem: In a right angled triangle, the area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the remaining sides of the triangle, which include the right angle. The area of the square on the side BC = 9 small squares The area of the square on the side AC = 25 small squares  Accordingly, the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides which include the right angle of the = 16 + 9 small squares = The area of the square on the hypotenuse AC of the right angled triangle ABC = 25 small squares  =  Therefore, in the right angled triangle ABC, the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides which include the right angle is equal to the area of the square on the hypotenuse of the triangle.                             In the right angled triangle KLM shown in the figure, KM is the hypotenuse while KL and LM are the remaining sides which include the right angle.   Area of the square drawn on the side KL = KL2  Area of the square drawn on the side LM = LM 2 Area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse KM = KM 2  Example 1 In the right angled triangle ABC, B = 90x length of the side AC.  = 52 + 122  = 25 + 144  = 169 ... AC = 169                           Example 2 Find the length of CD based on the information given in the figure. According to the figure, Pythagoras’ Theorem can be applied to the right angled triangle ABC. = 122 + 92 = 144 + 81 = 225 ... BC = 225 =15  CD 2 + BC 2 = BD 2  CD 2 + 152 = 172  CD 2 + 225 = 289  ... CD 2 = 289 – 225  = 64 ... CD = 8 ... the length of CD is 8 cm.    Now let us consider how Pythagoras’ Theorem can be used to solve practical problems. Example 3 One end of a wire is tied to a ring fastened at a point 1m below the top of a vertical utility pole, while the other end is tied to a ring fastened on the ground, 8 m away from the foot of the pole. The length of the wire between the two rings is 10 m. Find the height of the utility pole. (Assume that the wire is stretched.) As the pole PQ is vertical, it makes a right angle with the horizontal ground. Therefore PQS Since QRS is a right angled triangle, according to Pythagoras’ Theorem,                      QR 2 + QS 2 = RS 2  QR 2 + 82 = 102  QR 2 + 64 = 100  ... QR 2= 100 – 64  QR2 = 36 ... QR = 6    = 6 + 1  = 7  ... Height of the pole is 7 m.     Exercise 17.1 1. Fill in the blanks using the information in the figure. 3.

O = > > > >                                         17.3 Pythagorean triples A In the right angled triangle ABC in the figure, if the lengths of the sides which include the right angle are a and b units, and the length of the hypotenuse is c units, then we know that a2 + b2 = c2 according to Pythagoras’ Theorem. Values of a, b and c which satisfy the equation Since 32 + 42 = 52, we obtain that (3, 4, 5) is a Pythagorean triple. Any multiple of the triple (3, 4, 5) is also a Pythagorean triple. Eg: Multiplying each value of the triple (3, 4, 5) by 2 we obtain (6, 8, 10). Since 62 + 82 = 102, (6, 8, 10) is a Pythagorean triple. AD is perpendicular to BC in the equilateral triangle ABC in the figure. BC has been produced to E such that DC = CE. Prove that AE 2 = 7 EC 2. 5. The diagonals of the quadrilateral ABCD bisect each other perpendicularly at O.  Prove that AB2 + CD2 = AD 2+ BC 2 . P is a point within the triangle ABC. The perpendiculars drawn from the point P to the sides BC, AC and AB meet these sides at D, E and F respectively. Prove that,  (i) BP 2 – PC 2 = BD 2 – DC 2 and (ii) BD 2 + CE 2 + AF 2 = CD 2 + AE 2 + BF 2         Multiplying each value of the triple (3, 4, 5) by 3 we obtain (9, 12, 15). Since 92 + 122 = 152, (9, 12, 15) is also a Pythagorean triple. There are Pythagorean triples apart from the multiples of (3, 4, 5). Since 52 + 122 = 132, (5, 12, 13) is a Pythagorean triple. Since 82 + 152 = 172, (8, 15, 17) is a Pythagorean triple. A mathematician named Euclid introduced “parametric equations” to find Pythagorean triples. Given any two numbers x and y, if a = x2 – y2, b = 2xy and c = x2 + y2, then a2 + b2 = c2, and hence (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple.  b = 2xy = 2 6 5 = 60  c = x2 + y2 = 62 + 52 = 61 ' 1. The following triples are the lengths of the sides of two triangles. Select the triangle which is a right angled triangle and write down the corresponding Pythagorean triple. A 8 cm                 is a right angle. Using the triangle you constructed, find the value of 13 to the first decimal place.  is an acute angle. The foot of the perpendicular dropped from A to BC is X. Prove that AC 2 = AB2 + BC 2 – 2 BC.BX  a x2 – y2 b 2xy c x2 + y2 We know that we can use Pythagoras’ relationship to find the length of a side of a right angled triangle (right triangle) when the lengths of the other two sides are given. Pythagoras’ relationship cannot be used to find the lengths of the remaining sides of a triangle when the length of one side of a right triangle and the magnitude of an angle other than the right angle are given. To identify a method to do this, let us first see how the sides of a right angled triangle are named.  and  is defined as  is considered, then AB which  is called the “opposite side”. Moreover, the side BC which  , the other being the hypotenuse, is called the the hypotenuse of the triangle. When the angle C is directly opposite C is one of the arms of the angle C “adjacent side”. Accordingly, when A side” and AB is the “adjacent side”.  ² identify the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tangent,  ² perform calculations related to triangles using the sines, cosines and          Exercise 18.1 1.

The above ratios which are defined for right angled triangles are called trigonometric ratios. These trigonometric ratios are called the sine of the angle 30x, the tangent of the angle 30x and the cosine of the angle 30x, depending on the sides connected with them. “sin” is used for sine, “tan” is used for tangent and “cos” is used for cosine. Accordingly, the sine of the angle 30x is written as sin 30x, the tangent of the angle 30x is written as tan 30x and the cosine of the angle 30x is written as cos 30x. P Now let us write the trigonometric ratios for the triangle PQR in the figure using the notation given above.

The figure depicts an equilateral triangle ABC. Its vertex angles are each of magnitude 60x. We know that when the perpendicular AD from the vertex A to the side BC is drawn, D is the midpoint of BC and BAC  is bisected by AD. Then BAD  BD2 + AD2 = AB2  a2 + AD2 = (2a)2 = 3a2  AD = 3a

Now do the following exercise by using the values in the table in section 18.3. Exercise 18'3 1. Find the length x in each of the triangles given below using the information given  (i) sin 30x cos 60x + cos 30x sin 60x = 1  (ii) cos 60x cos 30x – sin 60x sin 30x = 0  (iii) tan 30x = tan 60x – tan 30x 1 + tan 60x tan 30x

However, there are trigonometric ratios for all angles from 0x to 90x. The trigonometric ratios corresponding to these angles have been tabulated. Separate tables have been prepared for sine, cosine and tangent. The “degree” which is a unit of angles can be divided into a smaller unit called “minute”. One degree is equal to 60 minutes. i.e., 1x = 60'. Trigonometric ratio values for angles in degrees and minutes are provided in the trigonometric tables. In all three tables, the sines, the cosines and the tangents, the first column has the angles from 0 to 90x. The following is a part of the Tangents Table. 4. Based on the information in the figure,  (i) find the length of AX.  (ii) find the length of AC.  ^ Take 3 = 1.7& 5. Find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle ABCD in the figure if the length of the side BC is 12 cm. 6. To keep an antenna post vertical, one end of a stretched wire has been attached to a point which is 50 cm below the top of the post, while the other end has been attached to a wedge which is firmly fixed to the horizontal ground, 5 m away from the foot of the post. The angle between the horizontal ground and the wire is 30x .  (i) Represent this information in a sketch.  (ii) Find the height of the post by taking 3 = 1.7           In the trigonometric ratios tables, the first column has the angles from 0x to 90x (Since only a portion of the table is given here, only the angles from 0x to 4x are shown). The parts of a degree which are minutes are given in the first row of the table as 0', 10', 20' etc., and as 1', 2', ...9' in the Mean Differences column. When finding the trigonometric ratio of an angle, the value in the relevant row and column, and sometimes the value in the Mean Differences column is used as is done when using the logarithms table. The ratios in the Tangents Table start with 0.0000, increase gradually, exceed 1.0000 and become extremely large as the angle approaches the magnitude 90x. Below is another portion of the Tangents Table. Let us first find the value of tan 43x. The value corresponding to tan 43x appears in the row which contains 43x and the column which contains 0'. Accordingly, tan 43x = 0.9325. Now let us find the value of tan 48x 20' We need to move along the row containing 48x until we arrive at the column containing 20'. Take the value.1237 which is in this position. Since the whole number part of the number 1.0117 at the top of the column containing 20' is 1, all the numbers along that column should also have a whole number part equal to 1. (The reason for writing the relevant whole number part only in the first row is to preserve the clarity of the tables). Accordingly, the value of tan 48x 20' is 1.1237. Let us find the value of tan 49x 57' similarly. Here the value of tan 49x 50' needs to be found first. To find the tangent value corresponding to 49x 57', we need to add the value from the Mean Differences column, corresponding to 7', which is 0.0048, to the value 1.1847 (as a convention, the mean difference is considered to be a value with four decimal places with only the non-zero part given in the tables). Example 1  (i) tan 34x 30' = 0.6873  (ii) tan 44x 42' = 0.9884 + 0.0011 When it is required to find an angle using the tables when a trigonometric ratio of the angle is known, a procedure similar to that followed in finding the antilog of a value using the logarithms table is used.        Find the value in the table which is closest to 1.1054 but less than it. This value is 1.1041. From the table it can be seen that the angle corresponding to this value is 47x 50'. We need to add 0.0013 to 1.1041 to obtain the value 1.1054. Therefore, the number of minutes corresponding to 0.0013 (that is, the value 13 in the Mean Differences column) has to be added to 47x 50' to obtain the correct angle. This is 2 minutes as highlighted in the table. Therefore, the angle of which the tangent value is 1.1054 is 47x 50' + 2' = 47x 52'. Therefore, θ = 47x 52' .  (i) If tan θ = 0.3706 θ = 20x 20'  θ = 25x 30' + 1' = 25x 31'  (iii) If tan θ = 0.8446 θ = 40x 11'    This table contains values from 0.0000 to 1.0000. As in the Tangents Table, the first column contains the angles from 0x to 90x . In the first row right at the top of the table, the minute values, namely 0' , 10' , 20' etc., and in the Mean Differences column, the values 1' , 2' , ... 9' appear. This table is used in the same way that the Tangents Table is used. Note: Although the values in the Tangents Table start from 0 and increase to very great values, the Sines Table contains only values from 0 to 1. The reason for this is because the sine value of an angle in a triangle always takes a value from 0 to 1. Let us find the value of sin 33x 27' using the table. First note that sin 33x20' = 0.5495. To obtain the value corresponding to the remaining7' , move along the row containing 33x and find the value corresponding to 7' from the Mean Differences column. This value is 0.0017. Add this value to 0.5495 to obtain the value of sin 33x27' . That is, sin 33x27' = 0.5495 + 0.0017 = 0.5512. Example 3  (i) sin 75x 44' = 0.9689 + 0.0003  = 0.7141  (iii) sin 39x 50' = 0.6406   Now let us use the table to find the angle corresponding to a given sine value. This is also done in the same way that we found the angle corresponding to a given tangent value. Let us find the angle θ if sin θ = 0.5075. It appear in the raw 30x and 30' column. accordingly if sin θ = 0.5075, the θ = 30x 30'. Now let us find another angle using the table. The angle θ if sin θ = 0.5277. Since 0.5277 does not appear in the table, consider the value 0.5275 which is the closest value in the table that is less than the given value. The angle corresponding to this is 31x 50' . Consider the values in the Mean Differences column along the same row to find the number of minutes corresponding to the remaining 0.0002. The number of minutes corresponding to the value 2 in the Mean Differences column is 1'. ∴ The angle of which the sine value is 0.5277 is 31x 51' . If sin θ = 0.5831 then θ = 35x 40'  (ii) If sin θ = 0.7036 (iii) If sin θ = 0.9691 then θ = 75x 43'    A B The above triangle is a right angled triangle with ABC Then, since the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180x, ACB = 90x Let us take BAC  = 90x – θ. The sum of the angles ACB pairs of angles are called complementary angles. side adjacent to A hypotenuse AB AC side opposite to C hypotenuse AB AC Find the value of cos 58x . =cos 58x = sin (90x – 58x) (according to the relationship that was obtained) = sin 32x = 0.5299 (according to the part of the table given above)      Find the value of cos 56x 18'. First let us find the value of 90 – 56x 18' . It is 33x 42' . Therefore cos 56x 18' = sin (90 – 56x 18' ) = sin 33x 42' We can similarly find the angle when the cosine value has been given. Let us consider an example. Find the value of θ if cos θ = 0.5175. Let us write this as sin (90 – θ) = 0.5175. Next let us find the angle of which the sine value is 0.5175. According to the table it is 31x 10' . The value of θ can be found by solving the above equation for θ. Then θ = 90 – 31x 10' = 58x 50' Note: The cosine value of an angle in a triangle, like the sine value of an angle in a triangle, always takes a value from 0 to 1. Apart from the above method, the cosine value of an angle in a triangle can also be found directly from the Sines Table. Observe that in the Sines Table, just before the Mean Differences column, there is a column with angle values which are obtained by subtracting the angle values in the first column from 90x. The cosine values of angles in a triangle can also be found by using the table values corresponding to the angle values in this column. However, in this case, the values in the Mean Differences column need to be subtracted instead of added. Now let us consider how to use the table in relation to cosine values. Let us find the value of cos 4x 20' using the table.      We need to consider the row corresponding to 4x in the “degrees” column on the right hand side and the column corresponding to 20' in the “minutes” column at the bottom. The value in the table in the row containing 4x, (found to the left), and in the column containing 20' is 0.9971. Therefore, cos 4x 20' = 0.9971. Now let us find the value of cos 9x 26' . We see that cos 9x 20' = 0.9868 and that the value corresponding to 6' is 0.0003. Now to obtain the value of cos 9x 26' , the value obtained from the Mean Differences column has to be subtracted from 0.9868. cos 9x 26' = 0.9868 – 0.0003  = 0.9865  
Example 6 Now let us find the angle θ such that cos θ = 0.4374.     The value in the table closest to 0.4374 and less than it is 0.4358. The angle which has this value as its cosine is 64x 10' according to the table. The value 0.0016 which is the difference between 0.4374 and 0.4358 is found in the column corresponding to 6’. This needs to be subtracted from 64x 10' . 64x 10' – 6' = 64x 4' ∴ the angle θ such that cos θ = 0.4374 is 64x 4' . Exercise 18.4 1. Find each of the following values using the Tangents Table.  a. tan 25x   The types of problems that were solved earlier involving the angles 30x, 45x and 60x only can now be solved for any angle in a triangle. It is important to take the following into consideration when solving problems related to trigonometry. 1' Consider a suitable right angled triangle. 2' Select a suitable angle in the triangle. 3' Use a suitable trigonometric ratio corresponding to the selected angle. 3. Find each of the following values using the Sines Table.  a. sin 10x 30' b. sin 21x 32' c. sin 25x 57' . Find the angle θ corresponding to each of the sine values given below.  a. sin θ = 0.5000 b. sin θ = 0.4348 c. sin θ = 0.6437 6. Find the angle θ corresponding to each of the cosine values given below.  a. cos θ = 0.4358 b. cos θ = 0.6450 c. cos θ = 0.9974      Now let us consider some examples. Example 1 Find the length of the side AC by using the information in the triangle ABC in the figure.      The angle in the triangle that is given is C. The length that is given is of the side opposite this angle. The length of the hypotenuse needs to be found. ∴The trigonometric ratio which involves these two sides, namely the sine ratio needs to be used. AB AC  10 AC  10  0.8437  10  0.8437 .  10  0.8437 = log 10 – log 0.8437 = 1 – 1.9262 = 1.0738 ∴ AC = antilog 1.0738 ∴ AC = 11.85 AD has been drawn perpendicular to the side BC of the  using the triangle ABC. Find the magnitude of ACB information in the figure.                                                              Here, the right angled triangle that needs to be considered to find the angle ACB is the triangle ADC. If the lengths of two sides of this triangle are known, then the required angle can be found. The length of one of its side, CD has been given as 5 cm. We need to find the length of one more side. Note that we can find the length of AD by considering the triangle ABD. Therefore, let us first find the length of AD by considering the triangle ABD and using the sine ratio.  AD AB AD 12  ... tan ACD ... ACD 8.7720  5  = 1.7544  = 60x 18' Exercise 18'5 1.

A plane which is perpendicular to a horizontal plane is a vertical plane. A post which is fixed perpendicular to the earth is a vertical post. Such a post is depicted in the figure. 3. Based on the information in the given figure, find  (i) the perimeter of the triangle ABC.  (ii) the area of the triangle ABC.                You learnt in grade 10 to determine locations using scale diagrams involving angles of elevation and angles of depression. Now let us learn how to find using the trigonometric ratios. Example 1 A man is standing on the flat ground at a point C which is 20 m away from the foot of a vertical pillar AB. The angle of elevation of the top of the pillar from this point is 30x 22'. The man travels 15 m from this point along a straight path away from the pillar to another point, and again observes the top of the pillar.  (i) Represent this information in a rough sketch.

Then, considering the right angled triangle ABD we obtain,  AB BD                           12 35  tan θ = 0.3428  ... θ = 18x 55'  
 
Example 2 A person stands by a small window of a vertical building consisting of several floors. The window is located at a height of 10 m above the flat ground. The person observes a motorcycle which is parked on the flat ground a long distance from the building. The angle of depression of the motorcycle from the window is 48x 23'.

(iv) The angle of elevation of the top of a utility post from the location where a child stands is 30x. The child travels a distance of 25 m along a straight path towards the utility post. The angle of elevation of the top of the utility post from this position is 50x. (Nelect the height of the child).             You have learnt earlier that bearings are used to indicate directions in a horizontal plane. Bearings provide a measure of an angle that is measured starting from the North and moving in a clockwise direction. Bearings are given using three digits. In modern measuring instruments the distance is also given with the bearing. The point A which lies to the East of P, is located at a distance of 225 m from P on a bearing of 090x. This can be represented in a figure as follows. 2. A security guard looking out from a window at the top of a lighthouse of height 20 m observes a ship travelling in the sea. The angle of depression of the ship from the top window is 30x 15'. Calculate the distance of the ship from the lighthouse. 3.

(i) Find the heights of the two posts.  (ii) A taut wire has been drawn from the top of one post to the top of the other    Let us see how calculations involving bearings are performed using trigonometric ratios by considering the following example. Example 1 A straight road runs from the South to the North. When observed from a point A on this road, point C is located at a distance of 250 m on a bearing of 220x. When observed from another point B on the same straight road, C is located on a bearing of 300x .  (i) Represent the above information in a sketch.

A group of forest conservationists observes from a distance that a fire has commenced in a forest. Using information they received on the location of the fire, starting from their camp C, they travel 2.5 km along a main road A on a bearing of 070x to the location P, and then from P by travelling 1.5 km on a bearing of 340x, they reach the location F of the fire.  (ii) Show with reasons that the group of conservationists was able to reach the location of the fire as quickly as possible, due to turning off the main road at P. When performing calculations involving trigonometric ratios using a scientific calculator, first the MODE key should be used to display “DEG” on the screen.

Let us identify matrices using a simple example. The marks obtained by Wimal, Farook and Radha in a term test, for the subjects Mathematics and Science are shown in the table below. 75 66 72 70 63 81 Here the columns indicate the subjects while the rows indicate the students. This information can also be represented in a matrix as follows. 75 72 63 66 70 81 By studying this lesson you will be able to,  ² identify a matrix  ² identify the elements and the order of a matrix  ² add and subtract matrices  ² multiply a matrix by an integer  ² multiply two matrices  ² solve problems related to matrices.

The elements of a matrix, apart from being numbers may also be algebraic symbols or expressions which stand for numbers. Matrices are named using capital letters of the English alphabet. In instances when elements are expressed in terms of algebraic symbols, simple letters of the English alphabet are used. 2 a c b 5 2 1 4 1 1 3 2 2 In a Cartesian plane, the coordinates of the points A and B are (0, 5) and (4, 3) respectively. Represent this information in a matrix. Name it P. As a matrix, 4 0 3 5 A 0 5 B 4 3 x y       Consider the matrix  A = 3 2 1 2 4 0 The number of rows in A is 2 and the number of columns is 3. Using the number of rows and number of columns, we write the order of the matrix as 2 × 3. A is known as a “two by three” matrix. 3 2 1 2 4 0 2 × 3.  (i) 3 2 1 2 1 3 = 3  Number of columns in the matrix = 2  Order of the matrix  Number of rows Number of columns Order of the matrix = 1 × 3 = 1 = 3 Number of rows Number of columns Order of the matrix = 2 × 1 = 2 = 1 Number of rows = 2 Number of columns = 2 Order of the matrix = 2 × 2 a b c d Matrices with only one row are known as row matrices, matrices with only one column are known as column matrices and matrices which have an equal number of rows and columns are known as square matrices. Since the number of columns                      and the number of rows of a square matrix are equal, the order of a square matrix with two rows and two columns is known as a square matrix of order 2 and a matrix with three rows and three columns is known as a square matrix of order 3 etc.  For example,  A = 3 2 1 4 1 3 0 5 3 0 3 6 2 2 5 1 4 1 0 In the square matrix given above, the main diagonal is highlighted. The string of elements from the top leftmost corner to the bottom rightmost corner is the main diagonal. 2 1 4 3 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1                The main diagonal of A consists of only the number 1. Apart from the diagonal elements, all the other elements are 0. This type of matrix is known as an identity matrix. The matrix A is the identity matrix of order 3 × 3. Given below is the identity matrix of order 2 × 2. 1 0 0 1 When naming identity matrices, the letter I is used. The identity matrix with n rows and n columns is written as I n × n . Accordingly, 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 ' 3 2 1 2 0 4 1 4 5 Consider the elements around the main diagonal of X. The elements around the main diagonal which are equal to each other are placed symmetrically about the main diagonal. Such matrices are called symmetric matrices. 1 5 5 3 1 0 0 1 The elements around the main diagonals of Y and Z which are equal are placed symmetrically about the main diagonal. Therefore these are symmetric matrices too. (i) Express the amount of fruits bought by Sarath as a row matrix. (ii) Express the amount of fruits bought by Kamal as a row matrix. (iii) Express the amount of fruits bought by Raju as a row matrix. (iv) Construct a matrix with quantities of fruits Sarath, Kamal and Raju             0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 , We have learnt how to add, subtract and multiply numbers. We have seen how easily we can solve problems by using these mathematical operations. We can similarly define mathematical operations on matrices too. Let us first consider how to add matrices. 4 2 9 1 0 5 1 3 2 6 9 8 3 1 0 0 b d a c 0 2 3 5 4 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 (i) square matrices (ii) symmetric matrices (iii) identity matrices 1 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 2 3 2 3 1 2 4 2 2 0 2 1 4 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 , 1 1 0 1        Both these matrices have the same order, 3 × 2. The addition of A and B is defined as the matrix which is obtained when the corresponding elements of A and B are added together. By corresponding elements we mean the elements which are in the same position of the matrix. For example, the element in the first row and second column of the matrix A is 1. The corresponding element in matrix B is 6; that is the number in the first row and second column of B. x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 x1 + y1 x3 + y3 x2 + y2 x4 + y4 The addition of matrices is defined only for matrices of the same order. Accordingly addition of matrices of different orders is not defined. Now let us consider how the addition of two matrices is used through an example. Even though this example is a very simple one, it shows clearly how matrices can be used in practical situations. Praveen and Tharindu are two bowlers in the school cricket team. The number of wickets they took in the years 2014 and 2015 in one day and two day matches are shown in the tables given below. 4 2 9 1 0 5 1 3 2 6 9 8 5 7 5 9 11 13        Let us name the matrix which has the information on the one day matches as A and the one with the information on the two day matches as B. 21 23 15 16 14 16 19 9 In these matrices the columns represent years while the rows represent wickets. Let us find A + B. 35 39 24 35 Think about what the matrix A + B represents. It shows the total number of wickets Praveen and Tharindu took in 2014 and 2015 in both one day and two day matches. It can be represented in a table as shown below. The subtraction of one matrix from another is also defined similarly. Here, the corresponding numbers are subtracted. For subtraction too, the orders of the two matrices should be equal. As an example, 5 2 9 3 1 6 4 0 If X is the 3 × 3 matrix with all the elements equal to 2 and Y is the 3 × 3 identity matrix, then find the matrix X – Y. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1         2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 3 10 9 a c b d For A and B to be equal matrices a = 2, b = 3, c = 10 and d = 9. That is, for two matrices to be equal, their orders should be equal and the corresponding elements of the two matrices should be equal.

Multiplying a matrix by a number means multiplying each element in the matrix by that number. The matrix obtained by multiplying matrix A by the number k is written as kA. Let us only consider multiplying by an integer. For example, let 2 1 4 0 5 2 – 2  1 (v) 5 3 – 2 4  4 3 – 2 1  3  (vi) 6 4  3 3 – 2  2  5  1  2 3 2  0 1 – 5  – 2  2  – 4 4. If 3 2  1  4  5 4  3 2  a b  c d 5. If 5 4 3 1  2  2  x  y 2 1  –1  z 8 2 5 2  1  3 6. If 2 – 3  2  1  x 3  y 1  1 0  0 1    2 1 4 0 5 2 – 2  1 6 3 12  0 From the above definitions you may have realized that addition and subtraction of matrices as well as multiplication of a matrix by a number are carried out as for numbers. However, multiplication of two matrices is done in a different way. This is shown below. Initially let us look at how to multiply a row matrix and a column matrix. If A is a row matrix of order 1 × m and B is a column matrix of order m × 1, then the matrix AB is defined and is of order 1 × 1 . To describe how matrix multiplication is done in this case, let us consider an example. 52  (i) 3  3 1  2 4  (ii) 4  2  3  (iii) 3  2 –1 3 –3 1 2 (iv) 2  2  0  3  
 (v) 3  1 0 – 2  3 – 1 2 – 3 2 0  3 – 2 – 4 1 2. Find a, b, c and d if 3 4 – 1  2 3  a c  b d 3. Find the values of x, y and z if 4  x  y  z  8  –12  2      b1  b2 Accordingly, the order of A is 1 × 2 while the order of B is 2 × 1. Then AB is defined as,  3  1 We learnt earlier that any matrix can be multiplied by a number. We also learnt that addition and subtraction of matrices however can be done only if the matrices are of the same order. Multiplication of matrices too can be done in some cases only. Above we saw how to multiply a row matrix and a column matrix. We can multiply matrices which are of different orders too. In general, AB is defined if the order of A is m × n and the order of B is n × p; that is, if the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B. In this case we get a matrix of order m × p, which is the number of rows of A into the number of columns of B. Let us now consider how such products of matrices are found.  2 4  3 5  1 8  6 7 When multiplying the above two matrices, multiply each row of A by each column of B, in the same way that we multiplied a row matrix by a column matrix.  1  6  1  6  8  7  8  7  26 44  33 59             ² The element in the first row and second column of AB is obtained by multiplying the first row of A (row matrix) by the second column of B (column matrix). ² The element in the second row and first column of AB is obtained by multiplying the second row of A (row matrix) by the first column of B (column matrix). ² The element in the second row and second column of AB is obtained by multiplying the second row of A (row matrix) by the second column of B (column matrix).  Any two matrices for which the product is defined (that is, the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B), can be multiplied as above. Let us look at a few more examples. If =X defined?  4 6  2 3  1  7 Number of columns in X = 2 and the number of rows in Y = 2. As the number of columns in X and the number of rows in Y are equal, XY is defined.  4 6  2 3  1  7  1  7  1  7  46  23           Now let us see whether YX is defined. The number of columns in Y is 1 while the number of rows in X is 2. As the number of the columns in Y is not equal to the number of rows in X, YX is not defined.  2  –1 we first defined the product of matrices of the form QP. This product can be found by using the above definition too. That is, by multiplying each row in Q by each column in P.  2  –1 This is a matrix with just one element. A matrix with only one element can be considered as a number. Therefore we write QP = 9. Furthermore PQ is also defined. The product of the matrices P and Q, namely PQ, is a 2 × 2 matrix.  2  –1  2 × 6 2 × 3  (–1) × 6 (–1) × 3  12 6 – 6 – 3 2 4 2  1 2 0 3 2  3 2 – 2 1 1 –2 2 1  (iii) 2 – 1 0 – 2 2  4 1 1  2 0  0 2 1 0 0 1  (viii) 1 0  0 1 3 1 2 2 1 2 2 1  3 – 2 – 2 3             3 0 1 2 2 –1 1 2 4.

Do the review exercise given below to recall what was learnt in grade 10 about  c solving inequalities of the form ax + b Let us now consider how to solve inequalities of the form ax + b algebraically and represent the solutions geometrically on a number line. When solving the inequality, all the terms with x should be carried to one side and the numerical terms should be carried to the other side (as in solving equations.)  x  2 + 5 ≤ 7  5x  6 + 4 ≥ 14   ² solve inequalities of the form ax + b  a number line,       This is the solution of the inequality. In words we can say that the solutions of the inequality are all real numbers greater than 3. This can be represented on a number line as shown below. To represent the fact that 3 is not a solution, a small un-shaded circle is drawn around the point denoting 3. Solve the inequality 5x + 3 ≤ 3x + 1 and represent the solutions of x on a number line. 2x 2 – 2 2 x ≤ – 1 Accordingly, the solutions of the inequality are all real numbers less than or equal to –1. The integral solutions of the inequality are all integers which are less than or equal to –1. That is –1, –2, –3 etc. This can be represented on a number line as shown below. Solve the inequality 2x – 5 ≥ 4x – 4 and represent the solutions of x on a number line. – 2x ≥ 1 – 2x – 2  x

Square tiles of two sizes are used to tile two rooms. The area of the larger tile is 900cm2. To tile room A, 100 small tiles and 10 large tiles are needed, while to tile room B, 20 small tiles and 30 large tiles are needed. If the area of the floor of room B is greater than or equal to the area of the floor of room A, using an inequality, find the maximum length that a side of the smaller tile could be. . A large bucket of capacity 5 litres and a small bucket are used to fill a tank with water. The tank can be filled completely by using the large bucket 12 times and the small bucket 4 times (assuming that both buckets are filled to the brim). When the tank was filled using the large bucket 9 times and the small bucket 9 times, the tank did not overflow. Using an inequality, find the maximum capacity of the small bucket. A quadrilateral which has all four vertices on the same circle is known as a cyclic quadrilateral. T (iii) It is clear that the quadrilaterals in figures (i) and (ii) are cyclic quadrilaterals while the quadrilaterals in figures (iii) and (iv) are not cyclic quadrilaterals. In a quadrilateral, the angle which is opposite a given angle is known as the “opposite angle”. For example, in the quadrilateral shown below, R  is the opposite angle of P and S  To understand the relationship between opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral let us do the following activity.  • identify the theorem that “if one side of a cyclic quadrilateral is produced, the exterior angle so formed is equal to the interior opposite angle of the quadrilateral”.     You would have observed the p + r = 180x and q + s = 180x. This relationship can be written as a theorem in the following form.

The following table has been filled by considering the cyclic quadrilateral PQRS in the figure. Interior opposite angle The relationship between an exterior angle and the interior opposite angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is given in the theorem below.

Therefore the straight line is situated external to the circle. In Figure (ii), the circle and the straight line intersect at two points. Therefore the circle and the straight line have two points in common. The straight line is known as a secant of the circle. In Figure (iii), the circle and the straight line have one point in common. Here the straight line touches the circle and therefore the straight line is known as a “tangent” of the circle. The point which is common to the tangent and the circle is known as the tangential point.                   To learn about the line drawn through a point on a circle which is perpendicular to the radius, consider the facts given below. O is the centre of the circle in the figure. The radius drawn through the point A which is on the circle is OA. The line drawn perpendicular to the radius OA through A is BC. It is clear that OAC That is, the line BC drawn perpendicular to the radius OA through the point A is a tangent to the circle. This result can be written as a theorem as follows. if a tangent is drawn to the circle through a particular point, then the radius that passes through that point and the said tangent are perpendicular to each other. Line drawn through a point on a circle, perpendicular to the radius          The tangent drawn to the circle with centre A through the point B is CD. If BAD  x = 180o – 35o – 90o  x = 55o In the figure, the tangent drawn to the circle with centre O through P is AB. If OP = AP and OBP              = 180o – 90o  = 90o  = 90o ( since PAO In the triangle APO,  + POA PAO  + OPA ...

Show that YX is a common tangent to the two circles. 8. In the given figure, AB is a diameter of the circle and PQ touches the circle at the point B. Prove that,  (i) QRB =  (ii) ABR =  90x and  RQB          Two tangents to the circle that pass through the point P can be drawn. These two tangents are shown in the following figure. These two tangents are known as the tangents drawn to the circle from the external point P. Understand that there are two tangents that can be drawn to a circle from an external point P irrespective of where the point is located. In the figure below are three points P, Q and R through which two tangents each are drawn.       Now let us consider the characteristics of the two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle. Let us mark A and B as the tangential points and OA and OB as the respective radii. Let us also draw the straight line segment OP. As learnt in section 22.1 above, tangents are perpendicular to the radii drawn through the tangential points. This is indicated in the above figure. Observing the triangles OAP and OBP, we might guess that they are congruent, based on symmetry. In fact they are congruent. This can easily be proved. Let us see how this is proved. First observe that they are both right angled triangles. Therefore if we show that the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and corresponding side of the other triangle, we can conclude that they are congruent under the RHS (Hyp.S) case. In both triangles, the hypotenuse is the common side OP. Furthermore, since OA and OB are both radii, they are equal in length. Accordingly, these two triangles are congruent under the RHS case. As they are congruent,  (i) AP = BP; that is, the tangents are equal in length.  (ii) APO  (iii) AOP circle.  = BPO  = BOP ; that is, the angle between the two tangents is bisected by OP. ; that is, both tangents subtend equal angles at the centre of the  (i) the two tangents are equal in length.  (ii) the angle between the tangents is bisected by the straight line joining the   (i) AP = BP (ii) APO (iii) POA = BPO = POB Now, in the triangles POA and POB, OA = OB (radii of the same circle) OP is the common side  POB (Hyp.S)  ...

If AB = 11cm and CR = 4 cm, find the perimeter of the triangle ABC. AP = AR BP = BQ CR = CQ = 19 + 11 = 30       As shown in the figure, the two tangents drawn from the external point C to the circle with centre O touches the circle at A and B. The line drawn from the centre O to C intersects the circle at D. Show that AD = BD. We can obtain the required result by proving that the two triangles ACD and BCD are congruent. In the triangles ACD and BCD, AC = BC ACO ( tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal in length) ( the angle between the tangents is bisected by the straight line joining CD is the common side ... ... AD = BD (corresponding sides of two congruent triangles) 1. The tangents through the points A and C on the circle with centre O in the figure, meet at B.

QO produced meets the circle at S. Show that,                          First let us see what an alternate segment is. To do this let us consider the following figure. As shown in the figure, the straight line AB touches the circle at the point C. In the figure, CD is a chord. The circle is divided into two segments by the chord CD. One segment is the portion which is shaded light blue. The other segment is the smaller portion which is not shaded. There are two angles formed by the chord CD meeting the tangent AB. One angle is ACD  The alternate segment corresponding to the angle BCD is the portion shaded light blue. Similarly, the alternate segment corresponding to the angle ACD  is the portion of the circle which is not shaded.  In the figure given below, the alternate segment corresponding to ACD light blue. 11. As shown in the figure, Q is a point on both circles and QS is a tangent to both circles. The other tangents drawn from S to the two circles touch the circles at P and R. Show that,  (i) PS = SR, (ii) PQR          Consider the figure given below. CPD blue. Therefore the angle CPD is in the alternate segment of ACD There is a special relationship involving tangents of a circle. For the above figure,  are equal, and also that the angles ACD it means that the angles DCB  are equal. In other words, “The angles which a tangent to a circle makes and CYD with a chord drawn from the point of contact are respectively equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle”. This is a very important result. Therefore let us write it as a theorem and remember it. Theorem: The angles which a tangent to a circle makes with a chord drawn from the point of contact are respectively equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle. ² Draw a circle and mark a point X on it. ² Draw a line touching the circle at X (draw a radius from X and draw a line 94     From the above activities you would have understood that the angles which a tangent to a circle makes with a chord drawn from the point of contact are respectively equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle. ² Draw a circle and mark a point on it and name it P.

B S    Let us learn some constructions which will be required in the constructions that will be studied later on. We use only a pair of compasses and a straight edge to do constructions. The perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment is the line drawn perpendicular to the straight line segment through its midpoint. Let us consider a straight line segment AB. Step 1: Take a length of a little more than half the length of AB onto the pair of compasses. Taking A as the centre, draw two arcs above and below the straight line segment.       Step 2: Using the same length (i.e., without altering the pair of compasses) and taking B as the centre, draw another two arcs such that they intersect the two arcs drawn earlier.       • do constructions related to straight lines and angles, • construct circles related to triangles, • construct tangents to circles.           CD is the perpendicular bisector of the straight line segment AB. Using a protractor, measure the magnitudes of the angles AXC , and using a cm/mm scale, measure the lengths of AX and BX. Thereby establish the fact that CD is the perpendicular bisector of AB. Step 1: Take a length which is less than OA and OB onto the pair of compasses.  Taking O as the centre, draw an arc such that it intersects both OA and  OB.   Step 3: Taking a suitable length onto the pair of compasses, and taking C and D as the centres, draw two arcs which intersect each other. Name the point of intersection of the two arcs as E.           OE is the angle bisector of AOB of the angles AOE Let us assume that we want to draw a perpendicular to AB through the point C which is on AB. Step 3: Taking P and Q as the centres and using a fixed radius, draw two arcs  above or below the line AB such that they intersect each other.                  CR is the perpendicular drawn to AB through C. Measure the angles ACR BCR the pair of compasses. Taking C as the centre, draw two arcs which intersect AB. Step 3: Taking the same radius (or another suitable one), draw two intersecting arcs taking D and E as the centres, on the side of AB opposite to that on   CP is the perpendicular drawn to AB from the point C. This can be established by measuring the magnitudes of the angles CQA              6. (i) Construct an equilateral triangle ABC of side length 6 cm.  (ii) Construct a perpendicular from each vertex of traingle ABC to the opposite You have learnt earlier how to construct triangles using a straight edge and a pair of compasses when lengths of the sides of the triangle and magnitudes of the angles are given. Now let us learn how to construct circles related to triangles in three cases, using only a straight edge and a pair of compasses. 4. (i) Construct the triangle PQR where PQ = 7cm, QR = 6.5 cm and PR = 5 cm.  (ii) Construct the bisectors of QPR 5. (i) Draw the straight line segment XY of length 5.5 cm.  (ii) Construct a perpendicular to XY through X.  (iii) Mark a point 4 cm from X on the perpendicular and name it Z. Join YZ.  Construction of the circumcircle (circumscribed circle) of a triangle    Observe that the constructed circle passes through all the vertices of the triangle ABC. This circle is known as the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. The centre of this circle is known as the circumcentre of the triangle. Draw a right angled triangle and an obtuse angled triangle and construct the circumcircle of each triangle.          Location of the circumcentre On a side of the triangle Outside the triangle Inside the triangle          You can see that the circle which was constructed touches the three sides AB, BC and CA internally. Therefore it is called the incircle of the triangle ABC. The centre of this circle is known as the incentre of the triangle.                     Observe that the circle touches the side BC and the sides AC and AB produced externally. Therefore it is named the excircle of the triangle ABC. Its centre is known as the excentre of the triangle. Note: The excircle that touches the side AB and the sides CB and CA produced, as well as the excircle that touches the side CA and the sides BA and BC produced can also be constructed similarly. It is clear therefore that each triangle has three excircles.          1. (i) Construct the triangle ABC where AB = 5 cm, BC = 4.5 cm and AC = 4 cm.

Construct the perpendicular bisector of the straight line segment OA. Name the point of intersection of OA and its perpendicular bisector as B. To do this construction, use the knowledge on constructing the perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment.

You have learnt in Grade 10 to identify regions in Venn diagrams which involve two sets and to express shaded regions in Venn diagrams using set notation. You can represent three subsets of the universal set in a Venn diagram too. Let us now consider how this is done. The following are different ways in which three nonempty subsets of a universal set can be represented in a Venn diagram.The first figure illustrates the most general form.  • identify the regions in a Venn diagram,  • express the regions in a Venn diagram using set notation,  • solve problems using Venn diagrams involving three sets.                                                                                                                Let A,B and C be three nonempty subsets of a universal set. Several cases of shaded regions in a Venn diagram which have been expressed using set notation are given below. Example 1 For each of the following cases, shade the region representing the given set in a copy of the Venn diagram provided here.  (i) P∩Q (iv) (P∩Q∩R)'           Next we will consider how to describe the nature of the elements that belong to a particular region in a Venn diagram in words. It is easier to understand this if we consider an example. The following Venn diagram provides information on what a group of students like to drink. Those who like tea The regions denoted by the capital letters of the English alphabet in the above Venn diagram can be described in words as follows. A - Those who like to drink tea, milk and coffee B - Those who like to drink only tea and milk. That is, those who like to drink tea  and milk but do not like to drink coffee C - Those who like to drink only tea and coffee D - Those who like to drink only milk and coffee E - Those who like to drink only tea F - Those who like to drink only milk G - Those who like to drink only coffee              Moreover, regions that are obtained by combining two or more of the above regions can also be described in words, most often in a simple way. A and B – Those who like to drink tea and milk B and C and D – Those who like to dring exactly two of these three types A and B and C and D – Those who like to drink at least two of these three types A and B and C and E – Those who like to drink tea E and F and G – Those who like to drink exactly one of these three types Example 2 The following Venn diagram provides information on the types of crops that a group of farmers cultivate. Describe each of the subsets which are denoted by the capital letters as well as the subsets denoted by the following composite regions.  (i) B and C  (ii) C and D  (iii) A and D and E A – Farmers who cultivate only paddy B – Farmers who cultivate only paddy and corn C – Farmers who cultivate paddy, corn and sesame D – Farmers who cultivate paddy and sesame but not corn E – Farmers who cultivate only sesame F – Farmers who do not cultivate any of these three crops B and C – Farmers who cultivate corn C and D – Farmers who cultivate paddy and sesame A and D and E –Farmers who cultivate at least one crop but do not cultivate corn Example 3 Let ε = {Families living in a Housing Scheme} C = {Families that own a car} M = {Families that own a motorcycle} F = {Families that own a bicycle}    These sets have been represented in the following Venn diagram. The numbers represent the number of elements in each subset. Answer the following questions by considering the Venn diagram.  (i) How many families own a car?  (ii) How many families own a motorcycle but neither  (iv) How many families own exactly two types of vehicles?  (v) How many families own at least two types of vehicles?  (vi) How many families own exactly one of these three types of vehicles?  (i) The set of households which have cars is denoted by C. All these households need to be considered. Therefore, the number of households which have cars is 20 + 8 + 10 + 15 = 53.  (ii) The set of households that have motor cycles is denoted by M. The households which have only motorcycles are those which have motorcycles but not cars or bicycles. Therefore, to obtain the answer, from the households which have motorcycles, those which also have either cars or bicycles have to be removed. Hence, the number of households which have only motorcycles is 34. (iii) The number of households which do not have bicycles is obtained by removing from all the households in the scheme, those which have bicycles. In other words, these households are those which have only cars, only motor cycles, only cars and motorcycles or those which do not have any of these three types of vehicles. This number is, 20 + 8 + 34 + 2 = 64 (iv) The households which have only two types of vehicles are those which have only cars and motorcycles or only cars and bicycles or only motorcycles and bicycles. This number is 15 + 8 + 11 = 34. (v) The households which have at least two types of vehicles are those which have either two types of vehicles or all three types of vehicles. This number is 15 + 8 + 11 + 10 = 44. (vi) The households which have only one type of vehicle are those which have only cars or only motorcycles or only bicycles. This number is 20 + 34 + 12 = 66. By using the above Venn diagram model, shade the region that denotes each of the following sets expressed in set notation and describe it in words. Use a different Venn diagram for each of the parts (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). By using the given Venn diagram model, shade the region that denotes each of the following sets expressed in set notation and describe it in words.

Represent this information in a Venn diagram and thereby determine the following. 122 C = {Those who like cricket} F = {Those who like football} B = {Those who like volleyball} group likes is given below. ε  (i) A∩B∩C (ii) B∩C'  (iii) A∩(B∩C)' (iv) (A∩B∩C)'                         (i) The number of students who learn only agriculture  (ii) The number of students who learn only one of these subjects  (iii) The number of students who learn at least two of these subjects  (iv) The number of students who do not learn any one of these three subjects Let us find the number of elements in the remaining regions using the given information. Those who learn Music Those who learn Health Science Those who learn Agriculture  (i) 10  (ii) 10 + 22 + 6 = 38 (iii) 17 + 6 + 11 + 8 = 42 (iv) 40 Example 2 According to the information gathered on the customers who visited a particular grocery store during a certain hour on a certain day, 50 bought rice, 21 bought lentils and 43 bought sugar. Moreover, everyone who bought lentils also bought rice. The given Venn diagram provides this and additional information. Those who bought rice      (i) Twenty three customers bought rice and sugar. How many bought only sugar?  (ii) Twelve customers bought all three items. How many bought only rice and (iii) How many bought only rice? (iv) If 90 people came to the grocery store during that hour, how many came to Answers Let us find the number of elements belonging to each region using the given information.  (i) The number of customers who bought items other than rice, lentils and sugar  = 90 – 70 = 20.    1. Information on 20 customers who bought items from a certain stationary shop is as follows. There were 8 who bought pencils, 11 who bought pens and 13 who bought books. Of the 6 who bought pencils and books, 4 did not buy pens. There were 3 who bought pencils and pens and 3 who bought only pens. Represent this information in a Venn diagram and determine the following.  (i) How many did not buy any of these three types of items?  (ii) How many did not buy pens?  (iii) What percentage of all the customers bought at least 2 of these 3 types? 2. The following information on the newspapers A, B and C that are purchased by a village community was obtained through a survey. 50% buy A, 67% buy B and 55% buy C. 10% buy only A and B, 15% buy only A and 5% buy A and C but not B. 17% do not buy A but buy B and C. Represent this information in a Venn diagram and determine the following.  (i) The percentage that buy all three newspapers.  (ii) The percentage that buy C but not A.  (iii) The percentage that buy only two of these three types. 3.

The sample space S of a random experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Assuming that the outcomes of this experiment are equally likely, answer the questions given below. . The following Venn diagram provides information on the number of elements in the subsets relevant to two events of a random experiment. ^i& P ^A& ^ii& P ^A' &. (iv) Find P ^B& and P ^B'&.  (v) X is another event with P(X) = 0.5 Write two events that X could be.  (i) n (ε)  (iv) P (A∩B) (v) P (A∩B) (vi) P (A∩B')  (vii) P (A'∩B) (viii) P (A∩B)'     (i) a grid (Cartesian plane) (ii) a tree diagram     We learnt in Grade 10 that if the occurrence of an event does not depend on the occurrence of another event, then the two events are independent. If A and B are independent we know that P (A∩B) = P(A)P(B). An example of this is given below. Let us consider the random experiment of flipping two coins simultaneously and noting the sides that are face up. It is clear that the side which is face up on one coin has no influence on the side which is face up on the other coin. Therefore the side which is face up on one coin is independent of the side which is face up on the other coin. If the occurrence of an event depends on the occurrence of another event, then they are called dependent events. That is, the occurrence of one event changes the probability of the other event. Deepen your understanding on dependent events further by studying the following examples. a. The probability of a team winning a cricket match depends on whether the best bowler of the team plays in the match or not. Therefore the two events of the best bowler playing and the team winning are dependent events. 4. Three identical cards numbered from 1 to 3 are in a bag. One card is drawn out at random and the number on it is checked to see if it is odd or even, and then the card is replaced in the bag. A card is drawn out again at random from the bag and the number is similarly checked to see whether it is odd or even.  (i) If the sample space is denoted by S, write S as a set and write down n(S).  (ii) If A is the event of both numbers drawn being even, write A as a set and write down n(A).  (iii) Hence find P (A)'  (iv) Represent S on a grid.  (v) If B is the event of drawing exactly one even number, then square the points        b. An animal is selected at random from a cattle pound in which there are cows and bulls. If the selected animal is a cow, milk can be obtained from it and if it is a bull, then milk definitely cannot be obtained from it. Therefore the event of selecting a cow and the event of obtaining milk are dependent events. c. A bag contains 7 white balls and 3 black balls which are identical in size and shape. Let us consider the experiment of randomly drawing out a ball and noting its colour, and then, without replacing the first ball, randomly drawing out another ball, and noting its colour. As the first ball is not replaced before the second ball is drawn, the number of balls in the bag when the second one is drawn out is not 10 but 9, and the number of balls of a particular colour remaining in the bag after the first ball is drawn depends on the colour of the first ball that is drawn.  The probability of the second ball being a white ball if the first ball  was white = 6 9  = 2 3  The probability of the second ball being a white ball if the first = 7 9  ball was not white As these two probabilities are not equal, the probability of the second ball being white is dependent on the probability of the first ball being white. When a random experiment occurs in two stages, the events of the two stages may be independent or dependent. In Grade 10 we learnt how to solve problems when the events of the two stages are independent. To review what was learnt, let us consider the following example. Example 1 In a bag there are 3 blue balls and 2 red balls of the same shape and size. A ball is randomly drawn out and the colour is noted. After replacing it, a ball is randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted.  (i) Represent the sample space of this random experiment on a grid. (ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the grid. (a) The first ball being red (b) The second ball being red (c) Both balls being red (d) Both balls being the same colour (e) At least one ball being red        (i) We have learnt earlier that a grid can be used to solve problems on probability only if all the outcomes of the random experiment are equally likely. Since all the balls are equal in size and shape, the probability of a ball being drawn out is the same for all the balls. Therefore the sample space can be represented on a grid and the required probabilities can be found. Let us name the three blue balls B1, B2 and B3 and the two red balls R1 and R2. B3 B2 B1 The sample space consists of all the points that are marked by taking the horizontal axis to represent the outcomes of the first draw and the vertical axis to represent the outcomes of the second draw. Since the second ball is taken out after replacing the first ball, the two events are independent of each other. The probability of an event is found using a grid, by dividing the number of points relevant to the given event by the total number of points in the sample space. (ii) The event of drawing a red ball on the first occasion is denoted by A on the grid. 10 points from the sample space belong to A. The whole sample space consists of 25 points. number of points in A number of points in the sample space  = 10 25 number of points in B number of points in the sample space  = 10 25               number of points common to both A and B number of points in the sample space  = 4 25 (d) For both balls to be the same colour, they should both be blue or both be red. The set of points relevant to this event is denoted by C. There are 13 points in this set. ... the probability of both balls being  the same colour number of points in C number of points in the sample space = 13 25 ... the probability of at least one ball being red = 16 25 Now let us consider an example of a random experiment consisting of two stages, where the events are dependent. In Sithija’s pencil box there are 2 red pencils and 3 blue pencils of the same size and shape. Sithija randomly draws one pencil out and gives it to his friend Thamilini. Then Sithija randomly draws another pencil out for himself.  (i) Write the sample space in terms of the outcomes and then represent it on a grid. (ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the grid. (a) Drawing a red pencil for Thamilini (b) Sithija drawing a red pencil for himself (c) Both getting pencils of the same colour (d) Only Thamilini getting a red pencil (i) Let us name the three blue pencils B1, B2, B3 and the two red pencils R1, R2.The pencil given to Thamilini is one of R1, R2, B1, B2, B3 and the pencil Sithija drew for himself is also one of these. However since Sithija cannot have the pencil which                  was given to Thamilini, the events (R1, R1), (R2, R2), (B1, B1), (B2, B2) and (B3, B3) cannot occur. Apart from these 5 points, the remaining 20 belong to the sample space. Therefore the sample space is the set }  (R1, R2), (R1, B1), (R1, B2), (R1, B3), (R2, R1), (R2, B1)... . This sample space can be represented on a grid as follows. R1 R2 B1 Thamilini’s pencil B1 R2 R1 (a) The 8 points corresponding to Thamilini receiving a red pencil is marked as A . ... probability of Thamilini receiving a red pencil = 8 20 (b) The 8 points corresponding to Sithija getting a red pencil is marked as B. ... probability of Sithija getting a red pencil = 8 20 ... probability of both getting pencils of the same colour = 8 20 ... probability of only Thamilini getting a red pencil = 6 20    (a) Write down the sample space S of all possible equally likely outcomes. (b) If the ball is put back into the box and a ball is randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted, draw the sample space of the equally likely outcomes of this experiment on a grid. (c) If the ball is not put back into the box and another ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted, draw the sample space of this experiment on a grid. (d) For the experiments described in (b) and (c) above, find separately, the 2. In a bag there are 4 ripe mangoes and 1 raw mango, all of the same size and shape. Saman randomly takes one mango from this bag and gives it to his friend Rajendra. After that Saman randomly takes out a mango for himself. A grid with the sample space prepared by Saman is given below. Ripe3 Ripe2 Ripe1 R i R i p R i p R i p (ii) Only Rajendra getting a ripe mango  (iii) Only one person getting a ripe mango       4. In a dish there were 3 milk toffees, 2 orange flavoured toffees and 1 tamarind flavoured toffee which were all the same size and shape. Sandaru randomly took one of these toffees and tasted it. Later she randomly took another one and gave it to her friend Jessie. A tree diagram can be used to find the probabilities of events related to a random experiment having many stages. In this lesson we will consider only random experiments having two stages. Let us study this by considering the following examples. In Grade 10 you learnt to find probabilities when the events were independent. Let us review what you learnt earlier. Example 1 In a bag there are two white balls and one black ball of the same size and shape. One ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted. After replacing it, a ball is randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted.  (i) Represent the sample space of this random experiment in a tree diagram. (ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the tree diagram. (a) Drawing a white ball on both occasions (b) Drawing a white ball on the first occasion (c) Drawing only one white ball (d) Drawing at least one white ball  (i) Both shirts being white  (ii) Only one shirt being white  (i) Both getting toffees of the same flavour. (ii) Only one person getting a milk toffee. (iii) Jessie getting a tamarind flavoured toffee.             (i) Let us denote the event of drawing a white ball by W and drawing a black ball by B. As the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of drawing a white ball out the first time is  . In that part of the  and a back ball out the first time is tree diagram which represents the first draw, let us indicate the probability of each of these two events on the relevant branches. Now let us extend the above tree diagram to indicate the probabilities of the second stage. The sum of the probabilities on the two branches = 2 3  = 1       As the second ball is drawn out after replacing the first ball, the number of balls in the bag when the second ball is drawn out is the same as the number that was in the bag initially. Therefore the probabilities of drawing a white ball and drawing a black ball on the second occasion are the same as those on the first occasion. These probabilities are marked on the appropriate branches. Notice that the sum of the probabilities on the branches that originate from a point, all add up to          As an example, (W,W ) represents the event of both balls drawn being white. Its  ' The reason why these two can be multiplied together probability is is because they are independent events. The four events (W, W), (W, B), (B, W) and (B, B) are mutually exclusive events. The reason for this is because, no two of these four events can occur together. The required probabilities can be calculated as follows.    
(a)Probability of drawing a white ball on the first occasion and a white ball on the second occasion too = P (W, W) = 4 9  = 2 3  = 6 9 = 4 9  = 4 9  = 2 9  = 8 9 = 4 9                           Example 2 In a bag there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls of the same size and shape. One ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted. Without replacing the first ball, a second ball is randomly drawn out and its colour too is noted.  (i) Represent the sample space in a tree diagram.  (ii) Using the tree diagram find the probability of each of the following events. (a) Drawing a red ball on both occasions (b) Drawing only one red ball (c) Drawing at least one red ball Here R represents the event of drawing a red ball while B represents the event of drawing a blue ball. As there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls in the bag,         How the probabilities relevant to the second draw were found can be described as follows. The probabilities on the branches in the second stage are different to those on the branches in the first stage. This is because the probabilities for the second stage have to be found after considering the first stage. If the first ball drawn is red, then the bag will have 2 red balls and 2 blue balls remaining. ... the probability of the second ball drawn being red = 2 4  The probability of the second ball drawn being blue = 2 4  
 
If the first ball drawn is blue, the bag will have 3 red balls and 1 blue ball remaining. ... the probability of the second ball drawn being red = 3 4  The probability of the second ball drawn being blue = 1 4 Let us write these probabilities on the relevant branches of the tree diagram, and complete the given outcomes table. Establish that the sum of the probabilities along the four branches is 1.  
 
       In the table, the probability of the outcome (R, R) (drawing two red balls) has been found by multiplying the relevant probabilities. But these two probabilities are not independent. This is because the probability of drawing a red ball on the second occasion depends on whether or not a red ball was drawn on the first occasion. Here however, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second occasion has been found by assuming that the first ball drawn is a red ball. Therefore to find the probability of (R, R), the two relevant probabilities can be multiplied. The events (R, R), (R, B), (B, R), (B, B) in the above table are mutually exclusive. Therefore to find the probability of a certain event using the tree diagram, we need to select the outcomes relevant to the event from the table and add the probabilities of these outcomes. (a) Probability of drawing two red balls = P (R, R)  = 3 10  = 6 20  
 
 
 
 
(b) Probability of drawing only one red ball = P (R, B) + P (B, R) 20 = 3 5  = 6 20 + 6 20 + 6 20  = 18 20  = 9 10          1. In a box with 10 bulbs of the same type, 3 are known to be faulty.

In grade 11 of a certain school there are three parallel classes. The number of children in these three classes is in the ratio 2: 2: 3. The teachers who teach mathematics to the three classes are A, B and C respectively. The principal makes the following statement based on his experience. “90% of the children in the class taught by A, 80% of the children in the class taught by B and 60% of the children in the class taught by C will pass the forthcoming examination.” Express the shaded region in the Venn diagram using set notation.
