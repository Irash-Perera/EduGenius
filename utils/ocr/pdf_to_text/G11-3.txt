We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience. The triangles ABC, PQR and KLM in the above figure are respectively an acute angled triangle, a right angled triangle and an obtuse angled triangle. These triangles have been thus named, by considering the largest (one or more) of the interior angles. Accordingly, the right angle PQR  is the largest interior angle of the triangle PQR. The side PR which is directly opposite this angle is the longest side of the triangle. This side is called the hypotenuse, and the remaining sides, namely PQ and QR, are known as the sides that include the right angle. There is evidence to show that from ancient times, man knew about the geometrical properties of triangles. The marvel of the pyramids made in Egypt around 3000 B.C. is accepted by us all. For such creations, knowledge of geometry, especially on the characteristics of triangles is essential. In the “Rhind Papyrus” of around 1650 B.C. too, the main shape that can be observed is the triangle. Using this knowledge on the geometry of triangles, in 600 B.C., the Greek mathematician Pythagoras presented a special relationship between the lengths of the sides of right angled triangles. Although there is evidence to show that this relationship was known by early civilizations in countries such as China and India, Pythagoras is considered to be the first to offer a geometrical proof of this relationship. Later on in 300 B.C., the mathematician named Euclid included this result as a theorem, together with its proof, in his historical book called THE ELEMENTS. ² identify Pythagoras’ Theorem ² use Pythagoras’ Theorem in calculations and to prove riders ² identify Pythagorean triples. A part of a floor on which tiles of the same shape and size have been placed is depicted in the above figure. The shape of each tile is an isosceles right angled triangle. Let us consider the isosceles right angled triangle PQR. The square PQAB has been drawn on the side PQ and the square RCDQ has been drawn on the side RQ (regions shaded in blue) of this triangle. The square drawn on the side PQ has an area equal to that covered by two tiles. Similarly, the square drawn on the side QR also has an area equal to that covered by two tiles, while the square PREF drawn on the hypotenuse PR has an area equal to that covered by four tiles. Accordingly, for the squares lying on the three sides of the isosceles right angled triangle PQR, it is clear that the following relationship holds. Paste the right triangular shaped lamina on a white paper. Paste the squares on the three sides of the triangle as shown in the figure given below. Using a square ruled paper, cut out 3 square shaped laminas and 1 triangular shaped lamina as follows.  (i) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 3 small squares  (ii) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 4 small squares  (iii) A square shaped lamina with side length equal to the length of 5 small squares  (iv) A right triangular shaped lamina, where the sides which include the right angle are of lengths equal to the length of 3 small squares and 4 small squares respectively.           This relationship between the sides of a right angled triangle, which was known from ancient days, can be expressed as a theorem as follows. Pythagoras’ Theorem: In a right angled triangle, the area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the remaining sides of the triangle, which include the right angle. The area of the square on the side BC = 9 small squares The area of the square on the side AC = 25 small squares  Accordingly, the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides which include the right angle of the = 16 + 9 small squares = The area of the square on the hypotenuse AC of the right angled triangle ABC = 25 small squares  =  Therefore, in the right angled triangle ABC, the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides which include the right angle is equal to the area of the square on the hypotenuse of the triangle.                             In the right angled triangle KLM shown in the figure, KM is the hypotenuse while KL and LM are the remaining sides which include the right angle.   Area of the square drawn on the side KL = KL2  Area of the square drawn on the side LM = LM 2 Area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse KM = KM 2  Example 1 In the right angled triangle ABC, B = 90x length of the side AC.  = 52 + 122  = 25 + 144  = 169 ... AC = 169                           Example 2 Find the length of CD based on the information given in the figure. According to the figure, Pythagoras’ Theorem can be applied to the right angled triangle ABC. = 122 + 92 = 144 + 81 = 225 ... BC = 225 =15  CD 2 + BC 2 = BD 2  CD 2 + 152 = 172  CD 2 + 225 = 289  ... CD 2 = 289 – 225  = 64 ... CD = 8 ... the length of CD is 8 cm.    Now let us consider how Pythagoras’ Theorem can be used to solve practical problems. Example 3 One end of a wire is tied to a ring fastened at a point 1m below the top of a vertical utility pole, while the other end is tied to a ring fastened on the ground, 8 m away from the foot of the pole. The length of the wire between the two rings is 10 m. Find the height of the utility pole. (Assume that the wire is stretched.) As the pole PQ is vertical, it makes a right angle with the horizontal ground. Therefore PQS Since QRS is a right angled triangle, according to Pythagoras’ Theorem,                      QR 2 + QS 2 = RS 2  QR 2 + 82 = 102  QR 2 + 64 = 100  ... QR 2= 100 – 64  QR2 = 36 ... QR = 6    = 6 + 1  = 7  ... Height of the pole is 7 m.     Exercise 17.1 1. Fill in the blanks using the information in the figure. 3.

(ii) Find the distance PQ.  = 90x Applying Pythagoras’ Theorem to the triangle ABC,  AC 2 = AB 2 + BC 2  AC 2 = AB 2 + AB 2 ^AB = BC, sides of a square& ∴ AC 2 = 2AB 2 In the rhombus ABCD, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at O.

O = > > > >                                         17.3 Pythagorean triples A In the right angled triangle ABC in the figure, if the lengths of the sides which include the right angle are a and b units, and the length of the hypotenuse is c units, then we know that a2 + b2 = c2 according to Pythagoras’ Theorem. Values of a, b and c which satisfy the equation Since 32 + 42 = 52, we obtain that (3, 4, 5) is a Pythagorean triple. Any multiple of the triple (3, 4, 5) is also a Pythagorean triple. Eg: Multiplying each value of the triple (3, 4, 5) by 2 we obtain (6, 8, 10). Since 62 + 82 = 102, (6, 8, 10) is a Pythagorean triple. AD is perpendicular to BC in the equilateral triangle ABC in the figure. BC has been produced to E such that DC = CE. Prove that AE 2 = 7 EC 2. 5. The diagonals of the quadrilateral ABCD bisect each other perpendicularly at O.  Prove that AB2 + CD2 = AD 2+ BC 2 . P is a point within the triangle ABC. The perpendiculars drawn from the point P to the sides BC, AC and AB meet these sides at D, E and F respectively. Prove that,  (i) BP 2 – PC 2 = BD 2 – DC 2 and (ii) BD 2 + CE 2 + AF 2 = CD 2 + AE 2 + BF 2         Multiplying each value of the triple (3, 4, 5) by 3 we obtain (9, 12, 15). Since 92 + 122 = 152, (9, 12, 15) is also a Pythagorean triple. There are Pythagorean triples apart from the multiples of (3, 4, 5). Since 52 + 122 = 132, (5, 12, 13) is a Pythagorean triple. Since 82 + 152 = 172, (8, 15, 17) is a Pythagorean triple. A mathematician named Euclid introduced “parametric equations” to find Pythagorean triples. Given any two numbers x and y, if a = x2 – y2, b = 2xy and c = x2 + y2, then a2 + b2 = c2, and hence (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple.  b = 2xy = 2 6 5 = 60  c = x2 + y2 = 62 + 52 = 61 ' 1. The following triples are the lengths of the sides of two triangles. Select the triangle which is a right angled triangle and write down the corresponding Pythagorean triple. A 8 cm                 is a right angle. Using the triangle you constructed, find the value of 13 to the first decimal place.  is an acute angle. The foot of the perpendicular dropped from A to BC is X. Prove that AC 2 = AB2 + BC 2 – 2 BC.BX  a x2 – y2 b 2xy c x2 + y2 We know that we can use Pythagoras’ relationship to find the length of a side of a right angled triangle (right triangle) when the lengths of the other two sides are given. Pythagoras’ relationship cannot be used to find the lengths of the remaining sides of a triangle when the length of one side of a right triangle and the magnitude of an angle other than the right angle are given. To identify a method to do this, let us first see how the sides of a right angled triangle are named.  and  is defined as  is considered, then AB which  is called the “opposite side”. Moreover, the side BC which  , the other being the hypotenuse, is called the the hypotenuse of the triangle. When the angle C is directly opposite C is one of the arms of the angle C “adjacent side”. Accordingly, when A side” and AB is the “adjacent side”.  ² identify the trigonometric ratios sine, cosine and tangent,  ² perform calculations related to triangles using the sines, cosines and          Exercise 18.1 1. Complete the following table using the given figures. K T (iii) W (iv) Right angled triangle Angle considered Opposite side Adjacent side               Do the following exercise to investigate the relationship between two sides of a right angled triangle and an angle of the triangle. were obtained from the activity, for the angle 30x, from all three triangles we obtain opposite side  hypotenuse ² Draw the angle XOY length 11 cm each. ² Using a set square or by some other method, draw lines perpendicular to OX through the points A, B and C and name the points that these perpendiculars meet OX as P, Q and R respectively. R ² Measure the lengths of the sides of each of the right angled triangles that are obtained and complete the following table. (Write down all measured values and calculated values to the nearest first decimal place).   Right angled triangle Hypot- enuse  Side opposite 30x Side adjacent to 30x 1.7 2 = 0.9 1 1.7 = 0.6  opposite side adjacent side Notice that the reason why a constant value is obtained for these ratios of sides of the right angled triangles in the above figure, is because the triangles are all equiangular. The above ratios which are defined for right angled triangles are called trigonometric ratios. These trigonometric ratios are called the sine of the angle 30x, the tangent of the angle 30x and the cosine of the angle 30x, depending on the sides connected with them. “sin” is used for sine, “tan” is used for tangent and “cos” is used for cosine. Accordingly, the sine of the angle 30x is written as sin 30x, the tangent of the angle 30x is written as tan 30x and the cosine of the angle 30x is written as cos 30x. P Now let us write the trigonometric ratios for the triangle PQR in the figure using the notation given above. PQ PR adjacent side hypotenuse QR PR PQ QR Now let us see how calculations are done using these three trigonometric ratios by considering some examples. In the triangle PQR in the figure, P PQR             (i) Find the length of the side QR.

The figure depicts an equilateral triangle ABC. Its vertex angles are each of magnitude 60x. We know that when the perpendicular AD from the vertex A to the side BC is drawn, D is the midpoint of BC and BAC  is bisected by AD. Then BAD  BD2 + AD2 = AB2  a2 + AD2 = (2a)2 = 3a2  AD = 3a  
If we consider the right triangle ABD, AD AB 3a 2a   BD AB  a  2a AD BD 3a  a 3  2 18.3 The trigonometric ratios of the angles of magnitude 30x, 45x  and 60x                 AD AB 3a  2a BD AD  a 3a 1 3 BD AB  a  2a Let us now use the isosceles right angled triangle PQR in the given figure to obtain the trigonometric ratios for the angle 45x. Let us take the length of the sides of the triangle that include the right angle to be x.  PR2 = x2 + x2  = 2x2  PR = 2x PQ QR QR PR  x 2x PQ PR  x The trigonometric ratios obtained for the angles of magnitude 30x, 60x and 45x are given in the following table.                                  In the right angled triangle ABC, B lengths of AB and BC. According to the figure, A AB 10 AB AC  AB = 5  ... the length of the side AB is 5 cm.   BC AC BC 10  ...

 A 5 m long ladder is kept leaning against a vertical wall such that the angle between the ladder and the horizontal is 60x. At what height above the horizontal ground does the top of the ladder touch the wall? QR PR  = 5 PR                                                                                                        Since the angle between the vertical wall and the horizontal  = 90x in the figure. ground is 90x, ABC AB AC  = AB 5  ... 3 2 5 3 2  ... the top of the ladder touches the wall at a height of 4.33 m above the ground. Now do the following exercise by using the values in the table in section 18.3. Exercise 18'3 1. Find the length x in each of the triangles given below using the information given  (i) sin 30x cos 60x + cos 30x sin 60x = 1  (ii) cos 60x cos 30x – sin 60x sin 30x = 0  (iii) tan 30x = tan 60x – tan 30x 1 + tan 60x tan 30x

However, there are trigonometric ratios for all angles from 0x to 90x. The trigonometric ratios corresponding to these angles have been tabulated. Separate tables have been prepared for sine, cosine and tangent. The “degree” which is a unit of angles can be divided into a smaller unit called “minute”. One degree is equal to 60 minutes. i.e., 1x = 60'. Trigonometric ratio values for angles in degrees and minutes are provided in the trigonometric tables. In all three tables, the sines, the cosines and the tangents, the first column has the angles from 0 to 90x. The following is a part of the Tangents Table. 4. Based on the information in the figure,  (i) find the length of AX.  (ii) find the length of AC.  ^ Take 3 = 1.7& 5. Find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle ABCD in the figure if the length of the side BC is 12 cm. 6. To keep an antenna post vertical, one end of a stretched wire has been attached to a point which is 50 cm below the top of the post, while the other end has been attached to a wedge which is firmly fixed to the horizontal ground, 5 m away from the foot of the post. The angle between the horizontal ground and the wire is 30x .  (i) Represent this information in a sketch.  (ii) Find the height of the post by taking 3 = 1.7           In the trigonometric ratios tables, the first column has the angles from 0x to 90x (Since only a portion of the table is given here, only the angles from 0x to 4x are shown). The parts of a degree which are minutes are given in the first row of the table as 0', 10', 20' etc., and as 1', 2', ...9' in the Mean Differences column. When finding the trigonometric ratio of an angle, the value in the relevant row and column, and sometimes the value in the Mean Differences column is used as is done when using the logarithms table. The ratios in the Tangents Table start with 0.0000, increase gradually, exceed 1.0000 and become extremely large as the angle approaches the magnitude 90x. Below is another portion of the Tangents Table. Let us first find the value of tan 43x. The value corresponding to tan 43x appears in the row which contains 43x and the column which contains 0'. Accordingly, tan 43x = 0.9325. Now let us find the value of tan 48x 20' We need to move along the row containing 48x until we arrive at the column containing 20'. Take the value.1237 which is in this position. Since the whole number part of the number 1.0117 at the top of the column containing 20' is 1, all the numbers along that column should also have a whole number part equal to 1. (The reason for writing the relevant whole number part only in the first row is to preserve the clarity of the tables). Accordingly, the value of tan 48x 20' is 1.1237. Let us find the value of tan 49x 57' similarly. Here the value of tan 49x 50' needs to be found first. To find the tangent value corresponding to 49x 57', we need to add the value from the Mean Differences column, corresponding to 7', which is 0.0048, to the value 1.1847 (as a convention, the mean difference is considered to be a value with four decimal places with only the non-zero part given in the tables). Example 1  (i) tan 34x 30' = 0.6873  (ii) tan 44x 42' = 0.9884 + 0.0011 When it is required to find an angle using the tables when a trigonometric ratio of the angle is known, a procedure similar to that followed in finding the antilog of a value using the logarithms table is used.        Find the value in the table which is closest to 1.1054 but less than it. This value is 1.1041. From the table it can be seen that the angle corresponding to this value is 47x 50'. We need to add 0.0013 to 1.1041 to obtain the value 1.1054. Therefore, the number of minutes corresponding to 0.0013 (that is, the value 13 in the Mean Differences column) has to be added to 47x 50' to obtain the correct angle. This is 2 minutes as highlighted in the table. Therefore, the angle of which the tangent value is 1.1054 is 47x 50' + 2' = 47x 52'. Therefore, θ = 47x 52' .  (i) If tan θ = 0.3706 θ = 20x 20'  θ = 25x 30' + 1' = 25x 31'  (iii) If tan θ = 0.8446 θ = 40x 11'    This table contains values from 0.0000 to 1.0000. As in the Tangents Table, the first column contains the angles from 0x to 90x . In the first row right at the top of the table, the minute values, namely 0' , 10' , 20' etc., and in the Mean Differences column, the values 1' , 2' , ... 9' appear. This table is used in the same way that the Tangents Table is used. Note: Although the values in the Tangents Table start from 0 and increase to very great values, the Sines Table contains only values from 0 to 1. The reason for this is because the sine value of an angle in a triangle always takes a value from 0 to 1. Let us find the value of sin 33x 27' using the table. First note that sin 33x20' = 0.5495. To obtain the value corresponding to the remaining7' , move along the row containing 33x and find the value corresponding to 7' from the Mean Differences column. This value is 0.0017. Add this value to 0.5495 to obtain the value of sin 33x27' . That is, sin 33x27' = 0.5495 + 0.0017 = 0.5512. Example 3  (i) sin 75x 44' = 0.9689 + 0.0003  = 0.7141  (iii) sin 39x 50' = 0.6406   Now let us use the table to find the angle corresponding to a given sine value. This is also done in the same way that we found the angle corresponding to a given tangent value. Let us find the angle θ if sin θ = 0.5075. It appear in the raw 30x and 30' column. accordingly if sin θ = 0.5075, the θ = 30x 30'. Now let us find another angle using the table. The angle θ if sin θ = 0.5277. Since 0.5277 does not appear in the table, consider the value 0.5275 which is the closest value in the table that is less than the given value. The angle corresponding to this is 31x 50' . Consider the values in the Mean Differences column along the same row to find the number of minutes corresponding to the remaining 0.0002. The number of minutes corresponding to the value 2 in the Mean Differences column is 1'. ∴ The angle of which the sine value is 0.5277 is 31x 51' . If sin θ = 0.5831 then θ = 35x 40'  (ii) If sin θ = 0.7036 (iii) If sin θ = 0.9691 then θ = 75x 43'    A B The above triangle is a right angled triangle with ABC Then, since the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180x, ACB = 90x Let us take BAC  = 90x – θ. The sum of the angles ACB pairs of angles are called complementary angles. side adjacent to A hypotenuse AB AC side opposite to C hypotenuse AB AC Find the value of cos 58x . =cos 58x = sin (90x – 58x) (according to the relationship that was obtained) = sin 32x = 0.5299 (according to the part of the table given above)      Find the value of cos 56x 18'. First let us find the value of 90 – 56x 18' . It is 33x 42' . Therefore cos 56x 18' = sin (90 – 56x 18' ) = sin 33x 42' We can similarly find the angle when the cosine value has been given. Let us consider an example. Find the value of θ if cos θ = 0.5175. Let us write this as sin (90 – θ) = 0.5175. Next let us find the angle of which the sine value is 0.5175. According to the table it is 31x 10' . The value of θ can be found by solving the above equation for θ. Then θ = 90 – 31x 10' = 58x 50' Note: The cosine value of an angle in a triangle, like the sine value of an angle in a triangle, always takes a value from 0 to 1. Apart from the above method, the cosine value of an angle in a triangle can also be found directly from the Sines Table. Observe that in the Sines Table, just before the Mean Differences column, there is a column with angle values which are obtained by subtracting the angle values in the first column from 90x. The cosine values of angles in a triangle can also be found by using the table values corresponding to the angle values in this column. However, in this case, the values in the Mean Differences column need to be subtracted instead of added. Now let us consider how to use the table in relation to cosine values. Let us find the value of cos 4x 20' using the table.      We need to consider the row corresponding to 4x in the “degrees” column on the right hand side and the column corresponding to 20' in the “minutes” column at the bottom. The value in the table in the row containing 4x, (found to the left), and in the column containing 20' is 0.9971. Therefore, cos 4x 20' = 0.9971. Now let us find the value of cos 9x 26' . We see that cos 9x 20' = 0.9868 and that the value corresponding to 6' is 0.0003. Now to obtain the value of cos 9x 26' , the value obtained from the Mean Differences column has to be subtracted from 0.9868. cos 9x 26' = 0.9868 – 0.0003  = 0.9865  
Example 6 Now let us find the angle θ such that cos θ = 0.4374.     The value in the table closest to 0.4374 and less than it is 0.4358. The angle which has this value as its cosine is 64x 10' according to the table. The value 0.0016 which is the difference between 0.4374 and 0.4358 is found in the column corresponding to 6’. This needs to be subtracted from 64x 10' . 64x 10' – 6' = 64x 4' ∴ the angle θ such that cos θ = 0.4374 is 64x 4' . Exercise 18.4 1. Find each of the following values using the Tangents Table.  a. tan 25x   The types of problems that were solved earlier involving the angles 30x, 45x and 60x only can now be solved for any angle in a triangle. It is important to take the following into consideration when solving problems related to trigonometry. 1' Consider a suitable right angled triangle. 2' Select a suitable angle in the triangle. 3' Use a suitable trigonometric ratio corresponding to the selected angle. 3. Find each of the following values using the Sines Table.  a. sin 10x 30' b. sin 21x 32' c. sin 25x 57' . Find the angle θ corresponding to each of the sine values given below.  a. sin θ = 0.5000 b. sin θ = 0.4348 c. sin θ = 0.6437 6. Find the angle θ corresponding to each of the cosine values given below.  a. cos θ = 0.4358 b. cos θ = 0.6450 c. cos θ = 0.9974      Now let us consider some examples. Example 1 Find the length of the side AC by using the information in the triangle ABC in the figure.      The angle in the triangle that is given is C. The length that is given is of the side opposite this angle. The length of the hypotenuse needs to be found. ∴The trigonometric ratio which involves these two sides, namely the sine ratio needs to be used. AB AC  10 AC  10  0.8437  10  0.8437 .  10  0.8437 = log 10 – log 0.8437 = 1 – 1.9262 = 1.0738 ∴ AC = antilog 1.0738 ∴ AC = 11.85 AD has been drawn perpendicular to the side BC of the  using the triangle ABC. Find the magnitude of ACB information in the figure.                                                              Here, the right angled triangle that needs to be considered to find the angle ACB is the triangle ADC. If the lengths of two sides of this triangle are known, then the required angle can be found. The length of one of its side, CD has been given as 5 cm. We need to find the length of one more side. Note that we can find the length of AD by considering the triangle ABD. Therefore, let us first find the length of AD by considering the triangle ABD and using the sine ratio.  AD AB AD 12  ... tan ACD ... ACD 8.7720  5  = 1.7544  = 60x 18' Exercise 18'5 1.

A plane which is perpendicular to a horizontal plane is a vertical plane. A post which is fixed perpendicular to the earth is a vertical post. Such a post is depicted in the figure. 3. Based on the information in the given figure, find  (i) the perimeter of the triangle ABC.  (ii) the area of the triangle ABC.                You learnt in grade 10 to determine locations using scale diagrams involving angles of elevation and angles of depression. Now let us learn how to find using the trigonometric ratios. Example 1 A man is standing on the flat ground at a point C which is 20 m away from the foot of a vertical pillar AB. The angle of elevation of the top of the pillar from this point is 30x 22'. The man travels 15 m from this point along a straight path away from the pillar to another point, and again observes the top of the pillar.  (i) Represent this information in a rough sketch.

Then, considering the right angled triangle ABD we obtain,  AB BD                           12 35  tan θ = 0.3428  ... θ = 18x 55'

You have learnt earlier that bearings are used to indicate directions in a horizontal plane. Bearings provide a measure of an angle that is measured starting from the North and moving in a clockwise direction. Bearings are given using three digits. In modern measuring instruments the distance is also given with the bearing. The point A which lies to the East of P, is located at a distance of 225 m from P on a bearing of 090x. This can be represented in a figure as follows. 2. A security guard looking out from a window at the top of a lighthouse of height 20 m observes a ship travelling in the sea. The angle of depression of the ship from the top window is 30x 15'. Calculate the distance of the ship from the lighthouse. 3.

Let us identify matrices using a simple example. The marks obtained by Wimal, Farook and Radha in a term test, for the subjects Mathematics and Science are shown in the table below. 75 66 72 70 63 81 Here the columns indicate the subjects while the rows indicate the students. This information can also be represented in a matrix as follows. 75 72 63 66 70 81 By studying this lesson you will be able to,  ² identify a matrix  ² identify the elements and the order of a matrix  ² add and subtract matrices  ² multiply a matrix by an integer  ² multiply two matrices  ² solve problems related to matrices.

The elements of a matrix, apart from being numbers may also be algebraic symbols or expressions which stand for numbers. Matrices are named using capital letters of the English alphabet. In instances when elements are expressed in terms of algebraic symbols, simple letters of the English alphabet are used. 2 a c b 5 2 1 4 1 1 3 2 2 In a Cartesian plane, the coordinates of the points A and B are (0, 5) and (4, 3) respectively. Represent this information in a matrix. Name it P. As a matrix, 4 0 3 5 A 0 5 B 4 3 x y       Consider the matrix  A = 3 2 1 2 4 0 The number of rows in A is 2 and the number of columns is 3. Using the number of rows and number of columns, we write the order of the matrix as 2 × 3. A is known as a “two by three” matrix. 3 2 1 2 4 0 2 × 3.  (i) 3 2 1 2 1 3 = 3  Number of columns in the matrix = 2  Order of the matrix  Number of rows Number of columns Order of the matrix = 1 × 3 = 1 = 3 Number of rows Number of columns Order of the matrix = 2 × 1 = 2 = 1 Number of rows = 2 Number of columns = 2 Order of the matrix = 2 × 2 a b c d Matrices with only one row are known as row matrices, matrices with only one column are known as column matrices and matrices which have an equal number of rows and columns are known as square matrices. Since the number of columns                      and the number of rows of a square matrix are equal, the order of a square matrix with two rows and two columns is known as a square matrix of order 2 and a matrix with three rows and three columns is known as a square matrix of order 3 etc.  For example,  A = 3 2 1 4 1 3 0 5 3 0 3 6 2 2 5 1 4 1 0 In the square matrix given above, the main diagonal is highlighted. The string of elements from the top leftmost corner to the bottom rightmost corner is the main diagonal. 2 1 4 3 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1                The main diagonal of A consists of only the number 1. Apart from the diagonal elements, all the other elements are 0. This type of matrix is known as an identity matrix. The matrix A is the identity matrix of order 3 × 3. Given below is the identity matrix of order 2 × 2. 1 0 0 1 When naming identity matrices, the letter I is used. The identity matrix with n rows and n columns is written as I n × n . Accordingly, 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 ' 3 2 1 2 0 4 1 4 5 Consider the elements around the main diagonal of X. The elements around the main diagonal which are equal to each other are placed symmetrically about the main diagonal. Such matrices are called symmetric matrices. 1 5 5 3 1 0 0 1 The elements around the main diagonals of Y and Z which are equal are placed symmetrically about the main diagonal. Therefore these are symmetric matrices too. (i) Express the amount of fruits bought by Sarath as a row matrix. (ii) Express the amount of fruits bought by Kamal as a row matrix. (iii) Express the amount of fruits bought by Raju as a row matrix. (iv) Construct a matrix with quantities of fruits Sarath, Kamal and Raju             0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 , We have learnt how to add, subtract and multiply numbers. We have seen how easily we can solve problems by using these mathematical operations. We can similarly define mathematical operations on matrices too. Let us first consider how to add matrices. 4 2 9 1 0 5 1 3 2 6 9 8 3 1 0 0 b d a c 0 2 3 5 4 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 (i) square matrices (ii) symmetric matrices (iii) identity matrices 1 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 2 3 2 3 1 2 4 2 2 0 2 1 4 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 , 1 1 0 1        Both these matrices have the same order, 3 × 2. The addition of A and B is defined as the matrix which is obtained when the corresponding elements of A and B are added together. By corresponding elements we mean the elements which are in the same position of the matrix. For example, the element in the first row and second column of the matrix A is 1. The corresponding element in matrix B is 6; that is the number in the first row and second column of B. x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 x1 + y1 x3 + y3 x2 + y2 x4 + y4 The addition of matrices is defined only for matrices of the same order. Accordingly addition of matrices of different orders is not defined. Now let us consider how the addition of two matrices is used through an example. Even though this example is a very simple one, it shows clearly how matrices can be used in practical situations. Praveen and Tharindu are two bowlers in the school cricket team. The number of wickets they took in the years 2014 and 2015 in one day and two day matches are shown in the tables given below. 4 2 9 1 0 5 1 3 2 6 9 8 5 7 5 9 11 13        Let us name the matrix which has the information on the one day matches as A and the one with the information on the two day matches as B. 21 23 15 16 14 16 19 9 In these matrices the columns represent years while the rows represent wickets. Let us find A + B. 35 39 24 35 Think about what the matrix A + B represents. It shows the total number of wickets Praveen and Tharindu took in 2014 and 2015 in both one day and two day matches. It can be represented in a table as shown below. The subtraction of one matrix from another is also defined similarly. Here, the corresponding numbers are subtracted. For subtraction too, the orders of the two matrices should be equal. As an example, 5 2 9 3 1 6 4 0 If X is the 3 × 3 matrix with all the elements equal to 2 and Y is the 3 × 3 identity matrix, then find the matrix X – Y. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1         2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 3 10 9 a c b d For A and B to be equal matrices a = 2, b = 3, c = 10 and d = 9. That is, for two matrices to be equal, their orders should be equal and the corresponding elements of the two matrices should be equal.

Multiplying a matrix by a number means multiplying each element in the matrix by that number. The matrix obtained by multiplying matrix A by the number k is written as kA. Let us only consider multiplying by an integer. For example, let 2 1 4 0 5 2 – 2  1 (v) 5 3 – 2 4  4 3 – 2 1  3  (vi) 6 4  3 3 – 2  2  5  1  2 3 2  0 1 – 5  – 2  2  – 4 4. If 3 2  1  4  5 4  3 2  a b  c d 5. If 5 4 3 1  2  2  x  y 2 1  –1  z 8 2 5 2  1  3 6. If 2 – 3  2  1  x 3  y 1  1 0  0 1    2 1 4 0 5 2 – 2  1 6 3 12  0 From the above definitions you may have realized that addition and subtraction of matrices as well as multiplication of a matrix by a number are carried out as for numbers. However, multiplication of two matrices is done in a different way. This is shown below. Initially let us look at how to multiply a row matrix and a column matrix. If A is a row matrix of order 1 × m and B is a column matrix of order m × 1, then the matrix AB is defined and is of order 1 × 1 . To describe how matrix multiplication is done in this case, let us consider an example. 52  (i) 3  3 1  2 4  (ii) 4  2  3  (iii) 3  2 –1 3 –3 1 2 (iv) 2  2  0  3  
 (v) 3  1 0 – 2  3 – 1 2 – 3 2 0  3 – 2 – 4 1 2. Find a, b, c and d if 3 4 – 1  2 3  a c  b d 3. Find the values of x, y and z if 4  x  y  z  8  –12  2      b1  b2 Accordingly, the order of A is 1 × 2 while the order of B is 2 × 1. Then AB is defined as,  3  1 We learnt earlier that any matrix can be multiplied by a number. We also learnt that addition and subtraction of matrices however can be done only if the matrices are of the same order. Multiplication of matrices too can be done in some cases only. Above we saw how to multiply a row matrix and a column matrix. We can multiply matrices which are of different orders too. In general, AB is defined if the order of A is m × n and the order of B is n × p; that is, if the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B. In this case we get a matrix of order m × p, which is the number of rows of A into the number of columns of B. Let us now consider how such products of matrices are found.  2 4  3 5  1 8  6 7 When multiplying the above two matrices, multiply each row of A by each column of B, in the same way that we multiplied a row matrix by a column matrix.  1  6  1  6  8  7  8  7  26 44  33 59             ² The element in the first row and second column of AB is obtained by multiplying the first row of A (row matrix) by the second column of B (column matrix). ² The element in the second row and first column of AB is obtained by multiplying the second row of A (row matrix) by the first column of B (column matrix). ² The element in the second row and second column of AB is obtained by multiplying the second row of A (row matrix) by the second column of B (column matrix).  Any two matrices for which the product is defined (that is, the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B), can be multiplied as above. Let us look at a few more examples. If =X defined?  4 6  2 3  1  7 Number of columns in X = 2 and the number of rows in Y = 2. As the number of columns in X and the number of rows in Y are equal, XY is defined.  4 6  2 3  1  7  1  7  1  7  46  23           Now let us see whether YX is defined. The number of columns in Y is 1 while the number of rows in X is 2. As the number of the columns in Y is not equal to the number of rows in X, YX is not defined.  2  –1 we first defined the product of matrices of the form QP. This product can be found by using the above definition too. That is, by multiplying each row in Q by each column in P.  2  –1 This is a matrix with just one element. A matrix with only one element can be considered as a number. Therefore we write QP = 9. Furthermore PQ is also defined. The product of the matrices P and Q, namely PQ, is a 2 × 2 matrix.  2  –1  2 × 6 2 × 3  (–1) × 6 (–1) × 3  12 6 – 6 – 3 2 4 2  1 2 0 3 2  3 2 – 2 1 1 –2 2 1  (iii) 2 – 1 0 – 2 2  4 1 1  2 0  0 2 1 0 0 1  (viii) 1 0  0 1 3 1 2 2 1 2 2 1  3 – 2 – 2 3             3 0 1 2 2 –1 1 2 4.

A quadrilateral which has all four vertices on the same circle is known as a cyclic quadrilateral. T (iii) It is clear that the quadrilaterals in figures (i) and (ii) are cyclic quadrilaterals while the quadrilaterals in figures (iii) and (iv) are not cyclic quadrilaterals. In a quadrilateral, the angle which is opposite a given angle is known as the “opposite angle”. For example, in the quadrilateral shown below, R  is the opposite angle of P and S  To understand the relationship between opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral let us do the following activity.  • identify the theorem that “if one side of a cyclic quadrilateral is produced, the exterior angle so formed is equal to the interior opposite angle of the quadrilateral”.     You would have observed the p + r = 180x and q + s = 180x. This relationship can be written as a theorem in the following form.  ABC  DCB   + CDA  + DAB  = 180x  = 180x Since the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary,  ∴ y = 180x – 70x  y = 110x ² Draw a cyclic quadrilateral as shown in the figure. ² Cut and separate out the angles in the cyclic quadrilateral. ² From the angles that were cut out, take the angles p and r and paste them on a piece of paper such that they are adjacent angles and see whether they form a pair of supplementary angles (that is, whether the sum of the magnitudes is 180x.) Do the same with the angles q and s. p B          x + 2x = 180x  3x = 180x ∴ x = 60x

That is, if the sum of the opposite angles of a quadrilateral is 180x, then its vertices lie on a circle.

The following table has been filled by considering the cyclic quadrilateral PQRS in the figure. Interior opposite angle The relationship between an exterior angle and the interior opposite angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is given in the theorem below.

Therefore the straight line is situated external to the circle. In Figure (ii), the circle and the straight line intersect at two points. Therefore the circle and the straight line have two points in common. The straight line is known as a secant of the circle. In Figure (iii), the circle and the straight line have one point in common. Here the straight line touches the circle and therefore the straight line is known as a “tangent” of the circle. The point which is common to the tangent and the circle is known as the tangential point.                   To learn about the line drawn through a point on a circle which is perpendicular to the radius, consider the facts given below. O is the centre of the circle in the figure. The radius drawn through the point A which is on the circle is OA. The line drawn perpendicular to the radius OA through A is BC. It is clear that OAC That is, the line BC drawn perpendicular to the radius OA through the point A is a tangent to the circle. This result can be written as a theorem as follows. if a tangent is drawn to the circle through a particular point, then the radius that passes through that point and the said tangent are perpendicular to each other. Line drawn through a point on a circle, perpendicular to the radius          The tangent drawn to the circle with centre A through the point B is CD. If BAD  x = 180o – 35o – 90o  x = 55o In the figure, the tangent drawn to the circle with centre O through P is AB.

Prove that,  (i) QRB =  (ii) ABR =  90x and  RQB          Two tangents to the circle that pass through the point P can be drawn. These two tangents are shown in the following figure. These two tangents are known as the tangents drawn to the circle from the external point P. Understand that there are two tangents that can be drawn to a circle from an external point P irrespective of where the point is located. In the figure below are three points P, Q and R through which two tangents each are drawn.       Now let us consider the characteristics of the two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle. Let us mark A and B as the tangential points and OA and OB as the respective radii. Let us also draw the straight line segment OP. As learnt in section 22.1 above, tangents are perpendicular to the radii drawn through the tangential points. This is indicated in the above figure. Observing the triangles OAP and OBP, we might guess that they are congruent, based on symmetry. In fact they are congruent. This can easily be proved. Let us see how this is proved. First observe that they are both right angled triangles. Therefore if we show that the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and corresponding side of the other triangle, we can conclude that they are congruent under the RHS (Hyp.S) case. In both triangles, the hypotenuse is the common side OP. Furthermore, since OA and OB are both radii, they are equal in length. Accordingly, these two triangles are congruent under the RHS case. As they are congruent,  (i) AP = BP; that is, the tangents are equal in length.

If AB = 11cm and CR = 4 cm, find the perimeter of the triangle ABC. AP = AR BP = BQ CR = CQ = 19 + 11 = 30       As shown in the figure, the two tangents drawn from the external point C to the circle with centre O touches the circle at A and B. The line drawn from the centre O to C intersects the circle at D. Show that AD = BD. We can obtain the required result by proving that the two triangles ACD and BCD are congruent. In the triangles ACD and BCD, AC = BC ACO ( tangents drawn to a circle from an external point are equal in length) ( the angle between the tangents is bisected by the straight line joining CD is the common side ... ... AD = BD (corresponding sides of two congruent triangles) 1. The tangents through the points A and C on the circle with centre O in the figure, meet at B.

QO produced meets the circle at S. Show that,                          First let us see what an alternate segment is. To do this let us consider the following figure. As shown in the figure, the straight line AB touches the circle at the point C. In the figure, CD is a chord. The circle is divided into two segments by the chord CD. One segment is the portion which is shaded light blue. The other segment is the smaller portion which is not shaded. There are two angles formed by the chord CD meeting the tangent AB. One angle is ACD  The alternate segment corresponding to the angle BCD is the portion shaded light blue. Similarly, the alternate segment corresponding to the angle ACD  is the portion of the circle which is not shaded.  In the figure given below, the alternate segment corresponding to ACD light blue. 11. As shown in the figure, Q is a point on both circles and QS is a tangent to both circles. The other tangents drawn from S to the two circles touch the circles at P and R. Show that,  (i) PS = SR, (ii) PQR          Consider the figure given below. CPD blue. Therefore the angle CPD is in the alternate segment of ACD There is a special relationship involving tangents of a circle. For the above figure,  are equal, and also that the angles ACD it means that the angles DCB  are equal. In other words, “The angles which a tangent to a circle makes and CYD with a chord drawn from the point of contact are respectively equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle”. This is a very important result. Therefore let us write it as a theorem and remember it.

Show that,  (i) PR = QS,  (ii) PQ // RS, (iii) A,B and X are on the same  straight line. B S    Let us learn some constructions which will be required in the constructions that will be studied later on. We use only a pair of compasses and a straight edge to do constructions. The perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment is the line drawn perpendicular to the straight line segment through its midpoint. Let us consider a straight line segment AB. Step 1: Take a length of a little more than half the length of AB onto the pair of compasses. Taking A as the centre, draw two arcs above and below the straight line segment.       Step 2: Using the same length (i.e., without altering the pair of compasses) and taking B as the centre, draw another two arcs such that they intersect the two arcs drawn earlier.       • do constructions related to straight lines and angles, • construct circles related to triangles, • construct tangents to circles.           CD is the perpendicular bisector of the straight line segment AB. Using a protractor, measure the magnitudes of the angles AXC , and using a cm/mm scale, measure the lengths of AX and BX. Thereby establish the fact that CD is the perpendicular bisector of AB. Step 1: Take a length which is less than OA and OB onto the pair of compasses.  Taking O as the centre, draw an arc such that it intersects both OA and  OB.   Step 3: Taking a suitable length onto the pair of compasses, and taking C and D as the centres, draw two arcs which intersect each other. Name the point of intersection of the two arcs as E.           OE is the angle bisector of AOB of the angles AOE Let us assume that we want to draw a perpendicular to AB through the point C which is on AB. Step 3: Taking P and Q as the centres and using a fixed radius, draw two arcs  above or below the line AB such that they intersect each other.                  CR is the perpendicular drawn to AB through C. Measure the angles ACR BCR the pair of compasses. Taking C as the centre, draw two arcs which intersect AB. Step 3: Taking the same radius (or another suitable one), draw two intersecting arcs taking D and E as the centres, on the side of AB opposite to that on   CP is the perpendicular drawn to AB from the point C. This can be established by measuring the magnitudes of the angles CQA              6. (i) Construct an equilateral triangle ABC of side length 6 cm.  (ii) Construct a perpendicular from each vertex of traingle ABC to the opposite You have learnt earlier how to construct triangles using a straight edge and a pair of compasses when lengths of the sides of the triangle and magnitudes of the angles are given. Now let us learn how to construct circles related to triangles in three cases, using only a straight edge and a pair of compasses. 4. (i) Construct the triangle PQR where PQ = 7cm, QR = 6.5 cm and PR = 5 cm.  (ii) Construct the bisectors of QPR 5. (i) Draw the straight line segment XY of length 5.5 cm.  (ii) Construct a perpendicular to XY through X.  (iii) Mark a point 4 cm from X on the perpendicular and name it Z. Join YZ.  Construction of the circumcircle (circumscribed circle) of a triangle    Observe that the constructed circle passes through all the vertices of the triangle ABC. This circle is known as the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. The centre of this circle is known as the circumcentre of the triangle. Draw a right angled triangle and an obtuse angled triangle and construct the circumcircle of each triangle.          Location of the circumcentre On a side of the triangle Outside the triangle Inside the triangle          You can see that the circle which was constructed touches the three sides AB, BC and CA internally. Therefore it is called the incircle of the triangle ABC. The centre of this circle is known as the incentre of the triangle.                     Observe that the circle touches the side BC and the sides AC and AB produced externally. Therefore it is named the excircle of the triangle ABC. Its centre is known as the excentre of the triangle. Note: The excircle that touches the side AB and the sides CB and CA produced, as well as the excircle that touches the side CA and the sides BA and BC produced can also be constructed similarly. It is clear therefore that each triangle has three excircles.          1. (i) Construct the triangle ABC where AB = 5 cm, BC = 4.5 cm and AC = 4 cm. (ii) Construct the perpendicular bisectors of the sides BC and AC. Name the  2. (i) Construct the triangle PQR where PQ = 6 cm, PQR  (ii) Construct the circumcircle of PQR. .

Name the point where they  (iii) Construct the bisectors of EDP  (ii) Produce the sides AB and AC and draw an excircle of the triangle ABC.  (iii) Measure and write down the radius of this circle.           To construct this, let us use the theorem, “The straight line drawn through a point on a circle and perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact is a tangent to the circle.”        To construct this, let us use the theorem, “The tangents drawn to a circle from an external point (exterior) are equal in length.” Join OA. Construct the perpendicular bisector of the straight line segment OA. Name the point of intersection of OA and its perpendicular bisector as B. To do this construction, use the knowledge on constructing the perpendicular bisector of a straight line segment.               AP and AQ are the tangents drawn to the circle with centre O from the point A. Using the protractor we can establish this by showing that the angles APO  and AQO           2. (i) Construct a circle of radius 3.5cm and name its centre O. Mark a point on the  circle and name it P. Construct a tangent to the circle through the point P.

You have learnt in Grade 10 to identify regions in Venn diagrams which involve two sets and to express shaded regions in Venn diagrams using set notation. You can represent three subsets of the universal set in a Venn diagram too. Let us now consider how this is done. The following are different ways in which three nonempty subsets of a universal set can be represented in a Venn diagram.The first figure illustrates the most general form.  • identify the regions in a Venn diagram,  • express the regions in a Venn diagram using set notation,  • solve problems using Venn diagrams involving three sets.                                                                                                                Let A,B and C be three nonempty subsets of a universal set. Several cases of shaded regions in a Venn diagram which have been expressed using set notation are given below. Example 1 For each of the following cases, shade the region representing the given set in a copy of the Venn diagram provided here.  (i) P∩Q (iv) (P∩Q∩R)'           Next we will consider how to describe the nature of the elements that belong to a particular region in a Venn diagram in words. It is easier to understand this if we consider an example. The following Venn diagram provides information on what a group of students like to drink. Those who like tea The regions denoted by the capital letters of the English alphabet in the above Venn diagram can be described in words as follows. A - Those who like to drink tea, milk and coffee B - Those who like to drink only tea and milk. That is, those who like to drink tea  and milk but do not like to drink coffee C - Those who like to drink only tea and coffee D - Those who like to drink only milk and coffee E - Those who like to drink only tea F - Those who like to drink only milk G - Those who like to drink only coffee              Moreover, regions that are obtained by combining two or more of the above regions can also be described in words, most often in a simple way. A and B – Those who like to drink tea and milk B and C and D – Those who like to dring exactly two of these three types A and B and C and D – Those who like to drink at least two of these three types A and B and C and E – Those who like to drink tea E and F and G – Those who like to drink exactly one of these three types Example 2 The following Venn diagram provides information on the types of crops that a group of farmers cultivate. Describe each of the subsets which are denoted by the capital letters as well as the subsets denoted by the following composite regions.  (i) B and C  (ii) C and D  (iii) A and D and E A – Farmers who cultivate only paddy B – Farmers who cultivate only paddy and corn C – Farmers who cultivate paddy, corn and sesame D – Farmers who cultivate paddy and sesame but not corn E – Farmers who cultivate only sesame F – Farmers who do not cultivate any of these three crops B and C – Farmers who cultivate corn C and D – Farmers who cultivate paddy and sesame A and D and E –Farmers who cultivate at least one crop but do not cultivate corn Example 3 Let ε = {Families living in a Housing Scheme} C = {Families that own a car} M = {Families that own a motorcycle} F = {Families that own a bicycle}    These sets have been represented in the following Venn diagram. The numbers represent the number of elements in each subset. Answer the following questions by considering the Venn diagram.  (i) How many families own a car?  (ii) How many families own a motorcycle but neither  (iv) How many families own exactly two types of vehicles?  (v) How many families own at least two types of vehicles?  (vi) How many families own exactly one of these three types of vehicles?  (i) The set of households which have cars is denoted by C. All these households need to be considered. Therefore, the number of households which have cars is 20 + 8 + 10 + 15 = 53.  (ii) The set of households that have motor cycles is denoted by M. The households which have only motorcycles are those which have motorcycles but not cars or bicycles. Therefore, to obtain the answer, from the households which have motorcycles, those which also have either cars or bicycles have to be removed. Hence, the number of households which have only motorcycles is 34. (iii) The number of households which do not have bicycles is obtained by removing from all the households in the scheme, those which have bicycles. In other words, these households are those which have only cars, only motor cycles, only cars and motorcycles or those which do not have any of these three types of vehicles. This number is, 20 + 8 + 34 + 2 = 64 (iv) The households which have only two types of vehicles are those which have only cars and motorcycles or only cars and bicycles or only motorcycles and bicycles. This number is 15 + 8 + 11 = 34. (v) The households which have at least two types of vehicles are those which have either two types of vehicles or all three types of vehicles. This number is 15 + 8 + 11 + 10 = 44. (vi) The households which have only one type of vehicle are those which have only cars or only motorcycles or only bicycles. This number is 20 + 34 + 12 = 66. By using the above Venn diagram model, shade the region that denotes each of the following sets expressed in set notation and describe it in words. Use a different Venn diagram for each of the parts (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). By using the given Venn diagram model, shade the region that denotes each of the following sets expressed in set notation and describe it in words. Use a different Venn diagram for each of the parts (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Determine the following based on the given Venn diagram.

Example 1 From a group of 120 students, 41 learn agriculture, 47 learn music and 42 learn health science. 14 students learn agriculture and music, 19 learn music and health science, 25 learn agriculture and health science and 8 learn all three subjects. Represent this information in a Venn diagram and thereby determine the following. 122 C = {Those who like cricket} F = {Those who like football} B = {Those who like volleyball} group likes is given below. ε  (i) A∩B∩C (ii) B∩C'  (iii) A∩(B∩C)' (iv) (A∩B∩C)'                         (i) The number of students who learn only agriculture  (ii) The number of students who learn only one of these subjects  (iii) The number of students who learn at least two of these subjects  (iv) The number of students who do not learn any one of these three subjects Let us find the number of elements in the remaining regions using the given information. Those who learn Music Those who learn Health Science Those who learn Agriculture  (i) 10  (ii) 10 + 22 + 6 = 38 (iii) 17 + 6 + 11 + 8 = 42 (iv) 40 Example 2 According to the information gathered on the customers who visited a particular grocery store during a certain hour on a certain day, 50 bought rice, 21 bought lentils and 43 bought sugar. Moreover, everyone who bought lentils also bought rice. The given Venn diagram provides this and additional information. Those who bought rice      (i) Twenty three customers bought rice and sugar. How many bought only sugar?  (ii) Twelve customers bought all three items. How many bought only rice and (iii) How many bought only rice? (iv) If 90 people came to the grocery store during that hour, how many came to Answers Let us find the number of elements belonging to each region using the given information.  (i) The number of customers who bought items other than rice, lentils and sugar  = 90 – 70 = 20.    1. Information on 20 customers who bought items from a certain stationary shop is as follows. There were 8 who bought pencils, 11 who bought pens and 13 who bought books. Of the 6 who bought pencils and books, 4 did not buy pens. There were 3 who bought pencils and pens and 3 who bought only pens. Represent this information in a Venn diagram and determine the following.  (i) How many did not buy any of these three types of items?  (ii) How many did not buy pens?  (iii) What percentage of all the customers bought at least 2 of these 3 types? 2. The following information on the newspapers A, B and C that are purchased by a village community was obtained through a survey. 50% buy A, 67% buy B and 55% buy C. 10% buy only A and B, 15% buy only A and 5% buy A and C but not B. 17% do not buy A but buy B and C. Represent this information in a Venn diagram and determine the following.  (i) The percentage that buy all three newspapers.  (ii) The percentage that buy C but not A.  (iii) The percentage that buy only two of these three types. 3. The following Venn diagram has been drawn with the information that was noted down on the languages that a group of tourists who visited Sigiriya could speak.  (i) How many can speak English?

Information on the types of fruits that were purchased by the customers who arrived at a grocery store one day is given in the following Venn diagram. On that day, all who bought either pineapples or papaws also purchased bananas. Those who bought pineapples  (i) How many bought pineapples?

The sample space S of a random experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Assuming that the outcomes of this experiment are equally likely, answer the questions given below. . The following Venn diagram provides information on the number of elements in the subsets relevant to two events of a random experiment. ^i& P ^A& ^ii& P ^A' &. (iv) Find P ^B& and P ^B'&.  (v) X is another event with P(X) = 0.5 Write two events that X could be.  (i) n (ε)  (iv) P (A∩B) (v) P (A∩B) (vi) P (A∩B')  (vii) P (A'∩B) (viii) P (A∩B)'     (i) a grid (Cartesian plane) (ii) a tree diagram     We learnt in Grade 10 that if the occurrence of an event does not depend on the occurrence of another event, then the two events are independent. If A and B are independent we know that P (A∩B) = P(A)P(B). An example of this is given below. Let us consider the random experiment of flipping two coins simultaneously and noting the sides that are face up. It is clear that the side which is face up on one coin has no influence on the side which is face up on the other coin. Therefore the side which is face up on one coin is independent of the side which is face up on the other coin. If the occurrence of an event depends on the occurrence of another event, then they are called dependent events. That is, the occurrence of one event changes the probability of the other event. Deepen your understanding on dependent events further by studying the following examples. a. The probability of a team winning a cricket match depends on whether the best bowler of the team plays in the match or not. Therefore the two events of the best bowler playing and the team winning are dependent events. 4. Three identical cards numbered from 1 to 3 are in a bag. One card is drawn out at random and the number on it is checked to see if it is odd or even, and then the card is replaced in the bag. A card is drawn out again at random from the bag and the number is similarly checked to see whether it is odd or even.  (i) If the sample space is denoted by S, write S as a set and write down n(S).  (ii) If A is the event of both numbers drawn being even, write A as a set and write down n(A).  (iii) Hence find P (A)'  (iv) Represent S on a grid.  (v) If B is the event of drawing exactly one even number, then square the points        b. An animal is selected at random from a cattle pound in which there are cows and bulls. If the selected animal is a cow, milk can be obtained from it and if it is a bull, then milk definitely cannot be obtained from it. Therefore the event of selecting a cow and the event of obtaining milk are dependent events. c. A bag contains 7 white balls and 3 black balls which are identical in size and shape. Let us consider the experiment of randomly drawing out a ball and noting its colour, and then, without replacing the first ball, randomly drawing out another ball, and noting its colour. As the first ball is not replaced before the second ball is drawn, the number of balls in the bag when the second one is drawn out is not 10 but 9, and the number of balls of a particular colour remaining in the bag after the first ball is drawn depends on the colour of the first ball that is drawn.  The probability of the second ball being a white ball if the first ball  was white = 6 9  = 2 3  The probability of the second ball being a white ball if the first = 7 9  ball was not white As these two probabilities are not equal, the probability of the second ball being white is dependent on the probability of the first ball being white. When a random experiment occurs in two stages, the events of the two stages may be independent or dependent. In Grade 10 we learnt how to solve problems when the events of the two stages are independent. To review what was learnt, let us consider the following example. Example 1 In a bag there are 3 blue balls and 2 red balls of the same shape and size. A ball is randomly drawn out and the colour is noted. After replacing it, a ball is randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted.  (i) Represent the sample space of this random experiment on a grid. (ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the grid. (a) The first ball being red (b) The second ball being red (c) Both balls being red (d) Both balls being the same colour (e) At least one ball being red        (i) We have learnt earlier that a grid can be used to solve problems on probability only if all the outcomes of the random experiment are equally likely. Since all the balls are equal in size and shape, the probability of a ball being drawn out is the same for all the balls. Therefore the sample space can be represented on a grid and the required probabilities can be found. Let us name the three blue balls B1, B2 and B3 and the two red balls R1 and R2. B3 B2 B1 The sample space consists of all the points that are marked by taking the horizontal axis to represent the outcomes of the first draw and the vertical axis to represent the outcomes of the second draw. Since the second ball is taken out after replacing the first ball, the two events are independent of each other. The probability of an event is found using a grid, by dividing the number of points relevant to the given event by the total number of points in the sample space. (ii) The event of drawing a red ball on the first occasion is denoted by A on the grid. 10 points from the sample space belong to A. The whole sample space consists of 25 points. number of points in A number of points in the sample space  = 10 25 number of points in B number of points in the sample space  = 10 25               number of points common to both A and B number of points in the sample space  = 4 25 (d) For both balls to be the same colour, they should both be blue or both be red. The set of points relevant to this event is denoted by C. There are 13 points in this set. ... the probability of both balls being  the same colour number of points in C number of points in the sample space = 13 25 ... the probability of at least one ball being red = 16 25 Now let us consider an example of a random experiment consisting of two stages, where the events are dependent. In Sithija’s pencil box there are 2 red pencils and 3 blue pencils of the same size and shape. Sithija randomly draws one pencil out and gives it to his friend Thamilini. Then Sithija randomly draws another pencil out for himself.  (i) Write the sample space in terms of the outcomes and then represent it on a grid. (ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the grid. (a) Drawing a red pencil for Thamilini (b) Sithija drawing a red pencil for himself (c) Both getting pencils of the same colour (d) Only Thamilini getting a red pencil (i) Let us name the three blue pencils B1, B2, B3 and the two red pencils R1, R2.The pencil given to Thamilini is one of R1, R2, B1, B2, B3 and the pencil Sithija drew for himself is also one of these. However since Sithija cannot have the pencil which                  was given to Thamilini, the events (R1, R1), (R2, R2), (B1, B1), (B2, B2) and (B3, B3) cannot occur. Apart from these 5 points, the remaining 20 belong to the sample space. Therefore the sample space is the set }  (R1, R2), (R1, B1), (R1, B2), (R1, B3), (R2, R1), (R2, B1)... . This sample space can be represented on a grid as follows. R1 R2 B1 Thamilini’s pencil B1 R2 R1 (a) The 8 points corresponding to Thamilini receiving a red pencil is marked as A . ... probability of Thamilini receiving a red pencil = 8 20 (b) The 8 points corresponding to Sithija getting a red pencil is marked as B. ... probability of Sithija getting a red pencil = 8 20 ... probability of both getting pencils of the same colour = 8 20 ... probability of only Thamilini getting a red pencil = 6 20    (a) Write down the sample space S of all possible equally likely outcomes. (b) If the ball is put back into the box and a ball is randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted, draw the sample space of the equally likely outcomes of this experiment on a grid. (c) If the ball is not put back into the box and another ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted, draw the sample space of this experiment on a grid. (d) For the experiments described in (b) and (c) above, find separately, the 2. In a bag there are 4 ripe mangoes and 1 raw mango, all of the same size and shape. Saman randomly takes one mango from this bag and gives it to his friend Rajendra. After that Saman randomly takes out a mango for himself. A grid with the sample space prepared by Saman is given below. Ripe3 Ripe2 Ripe1 R i R i p R i p R i p (ii) Only Rajendra getting a ripe mango  (iii) Only one person getting a ripe mango       4. In a dish there were 3 milk toffees, 2 orange flavoured toffees and 1 tamarind flavoured toffee which were all the same size and shape. Sandaru randomly took one of these toffees and tasted it. Later she randomly took another one and gave it to her friend Jessie. A tree diagram can be used to find the probabilities of events related to a random experiment having many stages. In this lesson we will consider only random experiments having two stages. Let us study this by considering the following examples. In Grade 10 you learnt to find probabilities when the events were independent. Let us review what you learnt earlier. Example 1 In a bag there are two white balls and one black ball of the same size and shape. One ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted. After replacing it, a ball is randomly drawn out again and its colour is also noted.  (i) Represent the sample space of this random experiment in a tree diagram. (ii) Find the probability of each of the following events using the tree diagram. (a) Drawing a white ball on both occasions (b) Drawing a white ball on the first occasion (c) Drawing only one white ball (d) Drawing at least one white ball  (i) Both shirts being white  (ii) Only one shirt being white  (i) Both getting toffees of the same flavour. (ii) Only one person getting a milk toffee. (iii) Jessie getting a tamarind flavoured toffee.             (i) Let us denote the event of drawing a white ball by W and drawing a black ball by B. As the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of drawing a white ball out the first time is  . In that part of the  and a back ball out the first time is tree diagram which represents the first draw, let us indicate the probability of each of these two events on the relevant branches. Now let us extend the above tree diagram to indicate the probabilities of the second stage. The sum of the probabilities on the two branches = 2 3  = 1       As the second ball is drawn out after replacing the first ball, the number of balls in the bag when the second ball is drawn out is the same as the number that was in the bag initially. Therefore the probabilities of drawing a white ball and drawing a black ball on the second occasion are the same as those on the first occasion. These probabilities are marked on the appropriate branches. Notice that the sum of the probabilities on the branches that originate from a point, all add up to          As an example, (W,W ) represents the event of both balls drawn being white. Its  ' The reason why these two can be multiplied together probability is is because they are independent events. The four events (W, W), (W, B), (B, W) and (B, B) are mutually exclusive events. The reason for this is because, no two of these four events can occur together. The required probabilities can be calculated as follows.    
(a)Probability of drawing a white ball on the first occasion and a white ball on the second occasion too = P (W, W) = 4 9  = 2 3  = 6 9 = 4 9  = 4 9  = 2 9  = 8 9 = 4 9                           Example 2 In a bag there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls of the same size and shape. One ball is randomly drawn out and its colour is noted. Without replacing the first ball, a second ball is randomly drawn out and its colour too is noted.  (i) Represent the sample space in a tree diagram.  (ii) Using the tree diagram find the probability of each of the following events. (a) Drawing a red ball on both occasions (b) Drawing only one red ball (c) Drawing at least one red ball Here R represents the event of drawing a red ball while B represents the event of drawing a blue ball. As there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls in the bag,         How the probabilities relevant to the second draw were found can be described as follows. The probabilities on the branches in the second stage are different to those on the branches in the first stage. This is because the probabilities for the second stage have to be found after considering the first stage. If the first ball drawn is red, then the bag will have 2 red balls and 2 blue balls remaining. ... the probability of the second ball drawn being red = 2 4  The probability of the second ball drawn being blue = 2 4  
 
If the first ball drawn is blue, the bag will have 3 red balls and 1 blue ball remaining. ... the probability of the second ball drawn being red = 3 4  The probability of the second ball drawn being blue = 1 4 Let us write these probabilities on the relevant branches of the tree diagram, and complete the given outcomes table. Establish that the sum of the probabilities along the four branches is 1.  
 
       In the table, the probability of the outcome (R, R) (drawing two red balls) has been found by multiplying the relevant probabilities. But these two probabilities are not independent. This is because the probability of drawing a red ball on the second occasion depends on whether or not a red ball was drawn on the first occasion. Here however, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second occasion has been found by assuming that the first ball drawn is a red ball. Therefore to find the probability of (R, R), the two relevant probabilities can be multiplied. The events (R, R), (R, B), (B, R), (B, B) in the above table are mutually exclusive. Therefore to find the probability of a certain event using the tree diagram, we need to select the outcomes relevant to the event from the table and add the probabilities of these outcomes. (a) Probability of drawing two red balls = P (R, R)  = 3 10  = 6 20  
 
 
 
 
(b) Probability of drawing only one red ball = P (R, B) + P (B, R) 20 = 3 5  = 6 20 + 6 20 + 6 20  = 18 20  = 9 10          1. In a box with 10 bulbs of the same type, 3 are known to be faulty.
