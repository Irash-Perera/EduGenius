We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience.     21. Graphs 22. Rate  20 43            Let us now consider how simplifications are facilitated by using the properties of indices. To do this, let us use the table of powers of 2 given below. Power of 2 Value 2x 1 21 2 22 4 23 8 24 16 25 32 26 28 27 64 128 256 29 210 512 1024     It can be seen that the above simplification was done easily and concisely by using the laws of indices. In the above example it was possible to write the numbers as powers of 2. Any expression containing the multiplication and division of numbers can easily be simplified using the logarithm tables. John Napier (1550 A.D. -1617 A.D.) a Scottish mathematician is bestowed with the honour of introducing the logarithm tables first. Briggs another mathematician who was a contemporary of Napier developed logarithms further. Although the use of the logarithm tables has reduced in recent years due to the widespread use of calculators, it is very important to learn the mathematical concepts related to logarithms. We know that 23 = 8. Here 8 is expressed as a power with base 2 and index 3. Such expressions are defined as '' index form''. This can also be expressed as the logarithm of 8 to base 2 is 3. This is written as log28 = 3, which is defined as the ''logarithm form''. It must be clear to you that the same statement is written in index form and in logarithm form. Accordingly, since 23 = 8, we also have log2 8 = 3. Similarly, log2 8 = 3, means 23 = 8. Let us consider several other examples. • Since 32 = 9, the logarithm of 9 to base 3 is 2. That is, log3 9 = 2. • Since 51 = 5, the logarithm of 5 to base 5 is 1. That is, log5 5 = 1. • Since103 = 1000, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3. That is, log10 1000 = 3. In general, for a positive number a, ax = N is considered as the index form and loga N = x is considered as the logarithm form. Here a and N take only positive values. (Since any power of a positive number is positive, in the above relationship, when a is positive, N is also positive.) Accordingly, when considering logarithms, the base always takes a positive value. That is, logaa = 1. This is because a1 = a. For example, log2 2 = 1 and log10 10 = 1' (ii) The logarithm of 1 to any base (other than 1) is 0. That is, loga1 = 0. This is because a0 = 1. For example, log21 = 0 and log101 = 0' We observe that so far we have obtained positive values for the logarithms. However, logarithms can also be negative. The logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is always negative. For example,  1. Write each of the following expressions in logarithm form.  (i) The logarithm of 32 to base 2 is 5.  (ii) The logartihm of 1000 to base 10 is 3. (iii) The logarithm of x to base 2 is y. (iv) The logarithm of q to base p is r.  (v) The logarithm of r to base q is p. Let us recall again how the value of 16 × 32 can be obtained by writing it in index form. = 24 « 25 = 24 + 5 = 29  Let us now consider 16 « 32 = 24 + 5. Let us convert this to logarithm form.  16 « 32 = 24 + 5 (Index form)  log2^16 « 32& = 4 + 5 (Logarithm form) Similarly, since 27 « 81 = 33 « 34 = 33 + 4,  log3^27 « 81& = 3 + 4'  log10^10 « 100& = log1010 ¬ log10100 and  log5^125 « 25& = log5125 ¬ log525' As seen above, when multiplying powers, an important fact about the behaviour of logarithms is highlighted. This is true in general for any product of powers and is expressed as follows. 2. Express each of the following in index form.  (i) log5125 = 3  (ii) log10100 000 = 5  (v) loga1 = 0  (iv) logpa = q 3. Express each of the following in logarithm form.  (i) 28 = 256  (iv) 202 = 400  (ii) 104 = 10000  (v) ax = y     (iii) logax = y (vi) logmm = 1 (iii) 73 = 343 (vi) pa = q 4. Solve each of the following equations.  (i) log3243 = x  (ii) log10100 = x  (iv) logx25 = 2  (v) logx64 = 6 (viii) log10x = 4 (vii) log3x = 2 5. (i) Write 64 as a power of four different bases.  (ii) Find four distinct pairs of values for x and y such that logx 64 = y. (iii) log6216 = x (vi) logx10 = 1  (ix) log8x = 2                This statement can also be expressed as “the logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of the logarithms”. Such a formula exists for the logarithm of a quotient too. Let us investigate this now. Let us consider the following example. Let us recall how the value of 128 ÷ 16 is obtained by converting it into index form. As seen above, when dividing powers, an important fact about the behaviour of logarithms is highlighted. This is true in general for any quotient of powers and is expressed as follows. These properties are called ''Laws of Logarithms.'' Now let us learn how to solve problems using these laws of logarithms by considering the following examples.    2 4 Express in terms of loga 2 and loga 3.  (i) loga6 (ii) loga18      (ii) log38 + log35  (v) loga10 – loga2 – loga5 (vi) log106 + log102 – log103 1. Simplify and express the answer as a single logarithm.  (i) log210 + log25  (iv) log620 – log64 2. Find the value of each of the following expressions.  (ii) log327 – log33  (i) log24 + log28  (iv) log280 – log215 + log212  (iii) log1020 + log102 – log104  (v) log1020 + log1010 – log102  (vi) log520 + log54 – log516 3. Write the following expressions in terms of loga5 and loga3.   4. Solve the following equations.  (i) log25 + log23 = log2x  (iii) log320 + log3x = log34 + log310  (v) log108 + log10x – log102 = log1012  (ii) loga10 + logax = loga30 (iv) loga15 – loga3 = logax (vi) log524 – log54 = log52 + log5x            4. Evaluate.  (i) log10 200 + log10300 – log1060 5. Solve.  (i) log10x – log102 = log103 – log104 + 1  (ii) log212 – log23 = log2x + 1   Let us recall several facts we have learnt earlier regarding logarithms. Since 10o = 1, we obtain log10 1 = 0. That is, the logarithm of 1 to base 10 is 0. Since 101 = 10, we obtain log10 10 = 1. That is, the logarithm of 10 to base 10 is 1. Since 102 = 100, we obtain log10 100 = 2. That is, the logarithm of 100 to base 10 is 2. Since 103 = 1000, we obtain log10 1000 = 3. That is, the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3. The following table has been prepared accordingly. This table provides the logarithm of the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 to base ten. Logarithm values exist for numbers between 0 and 1, between 1 and 10, between 10 and 100 etc also. These values are not whole numbers. The Scottish mathematician Henry Briggs who lived about four centuries ago prepared the logarithms table by calculating these values. He included only the logarithms of numbers from 1 up to 10. Below is given part of this logarithms table. 1875 0086 0492 0864 1206 1523 1903 0128 0531 0899 1239 1553 0170 0569 0934 1271 1584 0212 0607 0969 1303 1614 0253 0645 1004 1335 1644 2014 0334 0334 0334 0334 0334 3 0374 0755 1106 1430 0732 1987 0294 0682 1038 1367 1673 Mean difference 7 5 2 6 4 4 3 3 3 8 8 8 7 6 6 12 17 21 25 29 33 37 11 15 19 23 26 30 34 10 14 17 21 24 33 31 10 13 16 19 23 26 29 12 15 18 21 24 27 9 0000 0414 0792 1139 1461 0043 0453 0828 1173 1492 10 11 12 13 14 0170 0569 0934 1271 2 1584 0212 0607 0969 1303 3 1614 0253 0645 1004 1335 4 1644 0294 0682 1038 1367 6 1673 4 4 3 3 3 0374 0755 1106 1430 8 0732 0334 0334 0334 0334 7 0334 8 8 7 6 6 1 12 17 21 25 29 33 37 11 15 19 23 26 30 34 10 14 17 21 24 33 31 10 13 16 19 23 26 29 Mean difference 12 15 18 21 24 27 9 3 7 5 2 10 11 12 13 14 0000 0414 0792 1139 1461 0043 0453 0828 1173 1492 0086 0492 0864 1206 1523 0128 0531 0899 1239 1 1553  The numbers represented in the leftmost column under N by 10, 11, 12, …, 99 are 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, … , 9.9 which are from 1 up to 10. The decimal point (.) which should be placed in these numbers has not been indicated in the logarithms table. (This has been done to simplify the table). However, when using the table, the decimal point should be placed in the correct position. In the uppermost row, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, …, 9 have been written from left to right, and in the same row, on the right, the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 9 have been written under the mean difference. As an example the 29th row of the table is given below. In this row, the value in the 6th column is 4713. As mentioned earlier, the decimal point of the numbers is not written. But, when using the table, the decimal point should be placed in the correct position. That is, the value is 0.4713. This means that, the logarithm of 2.96 to base 10 is 0.4713. This also means that 100.4713 = 2.96. That is, when 2.96 is written as a power of ten it is 100.4713. Using the logarithms table we can find the logarithm of numbers consisting of up to 4 digits. When writing logarithms to base 10, instead of writing log10 we write lg in short. Example: log10 100 = 2 is written as lg 100 = 2. Note that to find the logarithm of 2.9, it must be written as 2.90. The value corresponding to the 29th row and the column indicated by 0 must be taken as the logarithm of 2.90; that is 0.4624. This is written as, log 10 2.9 = 0.4624 or lg 2.9 = 0.4624. Writing this in index form we obtain 2.9 = 10 0.4624. Let us identify how lg 4.58 is obtained using the logarithms table. The value that belongs to the row containing 45 which are the first two digits of 4.58 and the column containing 8, which is the remaining digit, is 0.6609. This value is the required logarithm. That is, the logarithm of 4.58 = lg 4.58 = 0.6609 Writing this in index form we obtain 4.58 = 100.6609.  Find the logarithm of each of the following numbers using the logarithms table. Indicate the relevant index form too. (i) 6'85 (ii) 3'4    (i) lg 6'85 = 0'8357" in index form 6.85 =100.8357  (ii) lg 3'4 = 0'5315" in index form 3'4 = 100'5315 ^Writing 3'4 as 3'40& (iii) lg 8 = 0'9031" in index form 8 = 100'9031 1. Using the logarithms table, find the logarithm of each of the following numbers.  Indicate the relevant index form too. (iii) 9.99  (ii) 1.05  (i) 7.32  (vi) 3.1 (vii) 4 (viii) 7 (iv) 5.8 (ix) 1 (x) 1.01  We now know how to obtain the logarithm of a number with up to two decimal places which lies between 1 and 10. Next let us consider how the logarithm of a number with three decimal places which lies between 1 and 10 is found. Let us identify how the logarithm of 5.075 which is a number with three decimal places is found using the table. The number 7050 is obtained from the table as the value which belongs to the row containing 50, which are the first two digits of 5.075, and the column containing 7 which is the third digit of this number. The mean difference in the same row, under the column containing 5, which is the fourth digit of 5.075 is 4. Mean difference 2 4 5 Now add 4 to 7050. Then since 7050 + 4 = 7054, we obtain lg 5.075 = 0.7054. The index form of this is 5.075 = 100.7054. Using the logarithms table, find the logarithm of each of the following numbers and then write each number in index form. 12 For free distribution           (ii) lg 5.875 = 0.7690" in index form 5.875 = 100.7690. (iii) lg 9.071= 0.9576" in index form 9.071 = 100.9576. Although only the logarithms of numbers from 1 up to 10 are included in the logarithms table, the logarithm of any other number (up to four digits or rounded off up to four digits) can also be found using the table. Now let us consider the strategy that is used in such a case. Find the logarithm of 54.37 Method (i): lg 54'37 = lg (5'437 × 101) (Representing in scientific notation) = 0'7354 + 1 (From the logarithms table and since lg 10 = 1) = 1'7354  54'37 = 5'437 × 101  =  100'7354 × 101 (Writing the value that is obtained from the table 0.7354 as an index of 10)  Find the logarithm of each of the following numbers.  (i) 8'583 (ii) 85'83 (iii) 858'3 (iv) 8583 lg 8'583 = lg ^ 8'583 « 100 & = lg 8.583 + lg 100 = 0'9337 + 0 = 0'9337  (i) lg 85'83 = lg ^ 8'583 « 101 & = lg 8.583 + lg 101 = 0'9337 + 1 = 1'9337  (ii) lg 858'3 = lg ^ 8'583 « 102 & = lg 8.583 + lg 102 = 0'9337 + 2 = 2'9337 (iii) (iv) lg 8583 = lg ^ 8'583 « 103 & = lg 8.583 + lg 103 = 0'9337 + 3 = 3'9337 Using the logarithms table, find the logarithm of each of the following numbers and then write each number in index form.                              (The decimal part of these logarithms remains the same since what is obtained from the table in each instance is the value in the 85th row, the 8th column and the 3rd mean difference column). In the logarithm 1.9337 of 85.83 in the above example, the decimal part of the logarithm is called the mantissa and the whole number 1 which is on the left of the decimal point is called the characteristic of the logarithm.  8.583  85.83  858.3  Number of digits in the integral part  1  2  3 Scientific Notation  Logarithm Characteristic of the logarithm  8.583 × 100  8.583 × 101  8.583 × 102  0.9337  1.9337  2.9337  0  1  2 According to the table, the characteristic of the logarithm of a number is the index of the power of ten, in the expression obtained when the number is expressed in scientific notation. For numbers which are larger than 1, the characteristic of the logarithm is one less than the number of digits in the integral part of the number. Accordingly, for numbers such as 5.673 which have just one digit in the integral part, the characteristic is 0. Find the logarithm of each number using the logarithms table. Write each number in index form too.  (i) 69.34 (ii) 957.1 (iii) 1248 (i) lg 69.34 = 1.8409" in index form 69.34 = 101.8409 (ii) lg 957.1 = 2.9809, in index form 957.1 = 102.9809 (iii) lg 1248 = 3.0962, in index form 1248 = 103.0962 2. If 100.8939 = 7.832, find each of the following values.  (i) lg 7.832 (ii) lg 78.32 (iii) lg 7832  According to the logarithms table, lg 59.3 = 1.7731. That is, the logarithm of 59.3 is 1.7731 . Another way of saying this is that 1.7731 is the logarithm of 59.3. Then we say that the antilogarithm of 1.7731 is 59.3. We write this as antilog 1.7731 = 59.3. Now let us consider how the antilogarithm is obtained when the mean difference section is also involved. 7 8432 Mean difference 6 7 2 3 4 5 antilog 0.8436 = 6.976 We can describe how the antilogarithm of 0.8436 was found using the above table as follows. Since this value is not in the table, we consider the number in the table which is less than this and closest to it. This value is 8432 which lies in the 69th row and 7th column. The difference 4 (= 8436 – 8432) is in the 6th column of the mean difference section. Accordingly, the required antilogarithm is 6.976 . (Since the characteristic of 0.8436 is 0 there is only one digit in the integral part of the antilog) When the characteristic of the logarithm is 0, the antilogarithm can be written directly from the table as in the above example, as a number between 1 and 10. However when the characteristic is greater than 0, the antilog can be found as shown in the following example. Find the value of antilog 1.8436 antilog 1.8436 = 6.976×101 (6.971 from the mantissa and 1 in 101 from the characteristic) Find using the logarithms table.  (i) antilog 1.5432 (ii) antilog 2.5432 (iii) antilog 3.5432                                                                            Now let us see how numbers can be multiplied and divided using the knowledge gained on logarithms up to this point, and the above laws. Evaluate using the logarithms table. ^i& 4.975 × 10.31 Let us take P = 4.975 × 10.31 Then, lg P = lg (4.975 × 10.31)  = lg 4.975 + lg 10.31 (Logarithm laws) = 0.6968 + 1.0132 = 1.7100 = 51.28 4.975 × 10.31 = 51.28   This product can also be obtained using the index laws 4.975 × 10.31 = 100.6968 × 101.0132 (From the logarithms table)  = 100.7100 « 101  = 5.128 « 101 1.

  The graph of a function of the form y = mx + c is a straight line. The coefficient of x, which is m, represents the gradient of the line and the constant term c represents the intercept of the graph. We defined the coefficient m of x in the equation y = mx + c as the gradient of the straight line. Now by considering an example, let us see how the value of m is represented geometrically. To do this, let us consider the straight line given by y = 2x + 1. Let us use the following table of values to draw its graph. x y (= 2x + 1) – 2 – 3 0 1 2 5   • find the gradient of the graph of a straight line, • draw the graph of a function of the form y = ax2 + b.  Let us mark any three points on the straight line. For example, let us take the three points as A (0, 1), B (2, 5) and C (5, 11). y C ^5" 11& First let us consider the points A and B. Let us draw a line from A, parallel to the x – axis, and a line from B, parallel to the y – axis, and name the point of intersection of these lines as P. It is clear that the coordinates of the point P are (2, 1). Also, length of AP = 2 – 0 Vertical distance Horizontal distance BP AP 4 = = 2 We already know the gradiant of the straight line y = 2x + 1 is 2. The quotient Vertical Distance Horizontal distance Now let us consider another case. As the second case let us consider the points B and C. Let us draw a line from B, parallel to the x - axis, and a line from C, parallel to the y - axis and name the point of intersection of these two lines as Q.  Then the coordinates of Q are (5, 5).  Length of BQ = 5 – 2  = 3 4 3 2 −1 −1 −2 −3 −4 −5       Vertical distance Horizontal distance CQ BQ 6 = = 3 In both instances, the ratio of the vertical distance to the horizontal distance between the two points under consideration is the gradient 2 of the straight line. Accordingly, let us develop a formula to find the gradient of a straight line using its graph. Let us consider any straight line with equation y = mx + c. Let us consider any two points A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2) on the straight line.

To obtain the equation, let us find the gradient and the intercept of the graph. Let us first find the gradient of the straight line, using the coordinates (1, 7) and (3, 15) of the two points on the line. Let us substitute the value of m and the coordinates of one of the points into the equation y = mx + c. Thereby we can find the value of c. The gradient of the graph is 4 and the intercept is 3. Therefore, the required equation is y = 4x + 3.      Now let us substitute the coordinates of the point (2, –1) and the gradient into the equation y = mx + c. Exercise 21.3 1.

Here a is a non-zero number. Here y is defined as the function. y can be considered as a function which is determined by ax2. First let us draw the graph of y = x2. To do this, let us proceed according to the following steps.

The maximum value that the y coordinate takes is 9 and the minimum value is 0. Let us draw the x and y axes according to a suitable scale, on the piece of paper that is to be used to draw the graph, so that the x - axis can be calibrated from –3 to 3 and the y - axis can be calibrated from 0 to 9. Step 3 Drawing the graph of the function. Let us mark the seven points on the coordinate plane that has been prepared. Next let us join the points that have been marked so that a smooth curve is obtained. This smooth curve is the graph of the function y = x2. 0 –1 The curve that is obtained as the graph of a function of the form y = ax2 is defined as a parabola. Let us identify several properties of the graph of the function y = x2 by considering the graph that was drawn.  For the function y = x2, • the graph is symmetric about the y - axis. Therefore, the y - axis is the axis of • when the value of x increases negatively (i.e., –3 to 0) the function decreases positively and when the value of x increases positively (i.e., 0 to +3) the function increases positively.

Accordingly, as the car moves forward from A, the rate at which the distance changes with respect to time is 2 metres per second. We can define this value as the speed with which the car travels from A to B. If the distance travelled by an object in motion is a constant per unit of time, then the object is said to be travelling with uniform speed. Further, the speed of the object is then the distance travelled per unit of time. From this point on, only objects which travel with uniform speed will be considered in this lesson. However, in reality, vehicles that travel on the main road are usually unable to maintain a uniform speed throughout the whole journey due to the traffic on the road and various other reasons. The instrument called the speedometer gives the speed of a vehicle at any given instance. The speed denoted by the speedometer in the figure can be written as 80 kmph. It can also be written as 80 km /h or as 80 kmh–1. • solve problems related to distance, time and speed • represent information related to distance and time graphically • solve problems related to liquid volumes, time and rate.     As you travel along a main road, you may observe road signs with 40 kmph and 60 kmph written on them to indicate speed limits. Try to recall that heavy vehicles such as lorries carry a board at the back with 40 kmph written on it. For an object that is moving with uniform speed, the relationship between the three quantities, namely the distance travelled, the time taken and the speed can be written as follows. A feather floating on air with uniform speed, drifts 100 m in 20 seconds. Calculate the speed with which the feather drifts. Calculate the distance travelled in one minute by a bird that flies at a uniform speed of 5 ms–1.  Distance it flies = speed « time  = 5 ms–1 « 60 s  = 300 m                                  Calculate the time it takes for a car to travel 150 km on a highway, at a uniform speed of 60 kmh–1. Distance  Speed How far does a motorcycle travel along a main road in 5 seconds, if its speedometer displays a constant speed of 36 kmh–1 during this period? Here, the speed has been given in kilometres per hour. Let us convert it to metres per second. Since the speed is 36 kmh–1,  distance travelled during an hour = 36 km  Distance travelled by the motorcycle in one second = 10 m  Distance travelled in 5 seconds                   
How long does it take a train which is 75 m long to pass a signpost, if it is travelling at a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1? When it reaches the signpost When it reaches the signpost When it passes the signpost When it passes the signpost The distance travelled by the train as it passes the signpost = 75 m First, let us find the speed in terms of metres per second.                                                      The speed of the train is 60 kmh-1.  . .. Distance travelled in one hour = 60 km  Distance travelled in one hour = Find the time it takes for a train of length 60 m travelling at a uniform speed of 72 kmh-1 to cross a bridge which is 100 m long.  60 m  60 m Here, the time taken for the train to travel a distance of 160 m needs to be found. For this, let us first find the speed in metres per second.     = 160 m  Distance travelled by the train in 1 second = 20 m  That is, time taken to travel 20 m = 1 second  . .. Time taken to travel 160 m                                  A vehicle travelling along a main road is usually unable to maintain the same speed throughout the journey. The concept of average speed is important in such situations. The value obtained when the total distance travelled by an object is divided by the total time taken is called the average speed. An intercity bus took an hour to travel the first 25 km of a journey. If it took the bus 1 hour to cover the remaining 80 km of the journey, find the average speed of the bus. Exercise 22.1 1. Calculate the speed of an aircraft which flies 1200 km in 4 hours with uniform 3. On a certain day, an electric train moving at a uniform speed, took 6 hours to travel a distance of 300 km. On another day, the train took 8 hours to travel the same distance. Find the difference between the speeds at which the train travelled during the two days.   A graph can be used to illustrate the change in the distance travelled by an object in motion, with respect to time. In such a graph, the x axis represents the time and the y axis represents the distance travelled. A graph of this form is called a distance-time graph. A table prepared with the information collected by observing the motion of a satellite travelling with uniform speed is given below. Time that has passed from the commencement of the journey (seconds) Distance from the starting point (metres) 9. A train leaves city A at 0800 h and travels at a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1 towards city B. Another train leaves city B at the same instance and travels at a uniform speed of 40 kmh-1 towards city A. If the distance between the two cities A and B is 100 km, calculate the time at which the two trains pass each other. 10. Two motorcyclists, who start their journeys at the same instance from two different cities, travel with uniform speeds of 40 kmh-1 and 50 km-1 respectively towards each other. If they meet each other an hour after commencing their   The speed of the satellite can be calculated by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. 500-300 25-15 200 10 Since the satellite is travelling with uniform speed, the speed can also be obtained by considering the distance travelled per unit of time. Accordingly, you can observe that the gradient of the graph and the speed of the satellite are equal. Therefore, for an object moving with uniform speed, a straight line is obtained as the distance-time graph, and the speed of the object can be obtained from the gradient of this line. A distance-time graph illustrating the motion of Nimal who cycled to his friend’s house and then returned back home after spending some time with his friend is given below.  (i) Calculate the speed at which Nimal cycled to his friend’s house.  (ii) Calculate the speed at which Nimal returned home. ² 0 B ²     B ²  Amount of time Nimal spent at his friend’s house = 20 minutes = 20 minutes                                      1. The following table provides information on the distance travelled by a car moving at a uniform speed along a highway, and the time taken for the journey.

(iii) Hence calculate the speed of the car. 24  (i) Draw a distance-time graph with the above information.  (ii) Find the gradient of the graph.  (iii) Hence calculate the speed of the object. 3. A coach, moving with uniform speed from the commencement of its journey, travels a distance of 60 km in 2 hours. It then travels another 40 km in 2 hours, also with uniform speed, and reaches its destination. Represent the motion of the coach in a distance-time graph. city on his motorcycle is given below. Distance (km)  (i) How far is it from his home to the city?  (ii) How long did it take him to reach the city? (iii) Calculate his average speed. D ² C ² B ² 30 Time (Minutes) ² 0  We defined speed as the distance travelled per unit of time. Another way of saying this is that speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. This idea of rate can also be used to describe various other processes that we come across in day to day life. Let us consider the example of water flowing out of a tap. If we collect the water that flows out from a tap during periods of one second each, and if by measuring we discover that the volume of water that flows out during each second is a constant, then we say that the water flows out at a uniform rate. Further, we call this constant value the rate at which water flows out from the tap. When time is measured in seconds and the volume of water is measured in litres, the unit of the rate of flow is litres per second (ls-1). Suppose it takes 20 minutes for a tank of capacity 1000 l to be filled completely using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate. Accordingly, the amount of water that flows out of the pipe per unit of time, that is, during one minute, is 50 litres. Therefore, we can express the rate at which water flows out of the pipe as 50 litres per minute. The time taken for 30 litres of petrol to be pumped into a car through a pump at a certain petrol shed was 60 seconds. Find the rate at which petrol flows out of the pump.                The length, breadth and height of a cuboid shaped indoor water tank are 2 m, and 1 m respectively. On an occasion when the tank was completely filled with water, it took 50 minutes for the tank to be emptied by a pipe. Find the rate at which water flowed out through the pipe. (Assume that the water flowed through the pipe uniformly)  3000 l  50 minutes A saline solution was administered to a patient at a rate of 0.2 mls-1. Calculate the time it takes for 450 ml of saline solution to be administered.                          volume time Volume of Saline Rate of administration 3 m, breadth 2m and height 1.5 m.  (i) Calculate the volume of the tank.  (ii) How many litres is the volume equal to?  (iii) How much time will it take to fill this tank completely using a pipe through 2. If it took 40 minutes to completely fill a cube shaped tank of side length 2 m using a pipe, what is the rate at which water flows through the pipe in litres per minute? (Hint: 1 m3 = 1000 l) 3. How long will it take to fill a fish tank of length 80 cm, breadth 60 cm and height 40 cm using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate of 6 l per minute? (Hint: 1 cm3 = 1 ml) 4. The volume of a tank at a water distribution centre is 1800 m3. If water is distributed from this tank at a rate of 500 ls-1, how many minutes will it take to empty half the tank?           3. The railway stations A and B are 300 km apart. A certain train takes 12 hours to travel from A to B and then back to A, after spending 2 hours at B. Another train leaves station A ten hours after the first train left A, and travels towards B at the same uniform speed. How far has the second train travelled when the two trains pass each other? 1. A cylindrical water tank of cross-sectional area 0.5 m2 is filled to a height of 70 cm in 1 minute and 10 seconds by a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate. Calculate the rate at which water flows out of the pipe. 2. The distance between railway stations X and Y is 420 km. A train leaves station X at 7.00 p.m. and travels towards station Y with a uniform speed of 100 kmh-1 . An hour later, another train leaves station Y and travels towards station X with a uniform speed of 60 kmh-1. At what time do the two trains pass each other?             You may recall that a formula expresses the relationship that exists between two or more physical quantities. If the area of a rectangle is denoted by A, then A can be expressed in terms of the length a and breadth b of the rectangle as A = a « b. A is called the subject of this formula. The subject of a formula can be changed if required. If the above formula is written in the form Do the following exercise to recall the facts you have learnt earlier about changing the subject of a formula. Review Exercise 1. Make u the subject of the formula 3. Consider the formula  ^i& Make a the subject of the formula.  ^ii& Make d the subject of the formula.  ^iii& Make n the subject of the formula.  ^iv& Find the value of d when l = 24" a = 3 and n = 8.  ^i& Make r1 the subject of the above formula.  ^ii& Find the value of r1 when R = 4 and r2= 6. • change the subject of a formula which involves squares and roots. • find the value of an unknown term in a formula when the values of the other unknown terms are given. Given below is the formula for the area of a circle. Here A denotes the area and r denotes the radius of the circle. Let us consider how r is made the subject of this formula. Let us first make r2 the subject of the formula. That is,  the subject of the formula, let us take the square root of both sides. Now, to make r the subject of the formula, let us take the square root of both sides.  denotes the positive square root value, remember that the signs + and denotes the positive square root value, remember that the signs + and Since  to denote the square root. In this – should be written in front of the symbol example, since r represents the radius of the circle, it is positive. Therefore, we can ignore the negative value. However, when the meanings of the unknowns are not known (or have not been given), the correct form is to have both signs. Let us see how l is made the subject of this formula. Let us first keep the term with the square root sign on one side of the equality symbol, and move all the other terms to the other side. symbol, and move all the other terms to the other side. Let us now square both sides.        If the values of all the unknowns in a formula except for one are given, then by substituting these values in the formula, the value of the remaining unknown can be found. Given below is the formula for the volume (v) of a cone, in terms of its radius (r) and its height (h). Find the value of r when v = 132 and h = 14' Let us first make r the subject of the formula. To solve this problem, it is not necessary to first make r the subject of the formula. 58 For free distribution        The known values can be substituted first, and then r can be made the subject. This is done as follows. The same answer is obtained by both methods. Therefore, either of the above two methods can be used to find the value of an unknown term. However, there are many benefits of knowing how to change the subject of a formula. For example, when it is required to find the base radius of several cones of different volumes, if r is made the subject of the above formula for the volume of a cone, then it will be very easy to perform the required calculations to find the different radii. Also, it is necessary to change the subject of the formula if these calculations are being done using a calculator or a computer. 1. Consider the formula  ^i& Find the value of a when v = 10" u = 0 and s = 10. ^ii& Find the value of s when v = 10" u = 5 and a = 2' ^iii& Find the value of u when v = 10" a = 3 and s = 6. 2. If ^i& find the value of x when y = 6 and z = 10. ^ii& find the value of y when x = 5 and z = 5.  ^i& Find the value of t when u = 0" a = 5 and s = 250. ^ii& Find the value of t when u = 5" a = 10 and s = 30.   1. The relationship between the base radius r, the height h and the volume V of a cylinder is given by V = πr2h. If a cylindrical shaped water tank of base radius 50 cm is filled with water to a height of 70 cm, find the volume of water in the 50 cm is filled with water to a height of 70 cm, find the volume of water in the tank. Take 3. The kinetic energy E of an object of mass m travelling with velocity v is given by  The kinetic energy 4. If the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is x, and the lengths of the other two sides are a and b respectively, then according to Pythagoras’ theorem, 5. The energy that a moving object possesses is given by the formula . In this formula, E denotes the energy of the object, m its mass,  v its velocity and h the height of its position.  ^i& Express the mass of the object in terms of the other quantities.  ^ii& Express the velocity of the object in terms of the other quantities. ^iii& The energy possessed by an object of mass 3 kg when it is 5 m above the  ^i& Express the radius of the sphere in terms of the surface area.  ^ii& If the surface area of a sphere is 616 cm2, find its radius. Take the formula ground is 153 N. Find the velocity of this object at this moment. Take g = 10 ms-1'     In earlier grades, you have learned various number patterns. A number pattern when indicated as a list is called a sequence of numbers or simply a sequence. Let us consider the following sequence. In this sequence, the first term is 3, the second term is 8, the third term is 13 etc. A feature of this sequence is that, considering any two consecutive terms in the sequence, when the first term is subtracted from the second term, a constant value is obtained. In this case, the constant value is 5. A similar sequence is shown below. In this sequence too, when the first term is subtracted from the second term, for any pair of consecutive terms, a constant value is obtained. In this case, the constant value is –3. Sequences having this feature are called arithmetic progressions. The constant value obtained by subtracting any term from the term right after that term is called the common difference, and is usually denoted by d. By studying this lesson, you will be able to  recognize arithmetic progressions and solve problems related to arithmetic  progressions. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that a constant value is obtained when any term is subtracted from the term right after that term.   The following notation is used to denote the terms of an arithmetic progression. T1= 1st term T2= 2nd term T3= 3rd term etc. For example, for the arithmetic progression 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,... we may write T1= 6" T2= 8, T3= 10, T4= 12, T5= 14 etc . What is the 25th term of this progression? In other words, what is the value of T25? It is clear that if you continue writing the terms according to the above pattern, the 25th term appears when you write 25 terms. If you do this, you will get 54 as the 25th term. That is, T25 = 54. Now, if you require to find the 500th term of this progression, how would you find it? For this you would have to write down 500 terms following the pattern, which is quite a tedious task. Let us see how we can derive a formula that can be used to find any term of an arithmetic progression rather easily. Let us illustrate this derivation using the above arithmetic progression 6, 8, 10, 12, ... For this progression, the first term is 6 and the common difference is 2. Observe carefully how the terms of this progression have been written in terms of the first term and the common difference in the following table. T1 T2 T3 T4 ...  Value of the term  6  8  10  12  ''' Value of the term in terms of the first term and the common difference  6 = 6 + (1 – 1) × 2  6 + 2 = 6 + (2 – 1) × 2  6 + 2 + 2 = 6 + (3 – 1) × 2  6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 + (4 – 1) × 2  ... ... Now, according to the pattern in the table, T500  = 6 + 499 × 2  = 6 + 998  = 1004 Hence, the 500th term is 1004. Can you generalize the above pattern further? In other words, can you find a formula for the nth term Tn in terms of the first term a and the common difference d? For this, look at the expression T500 = 6 + (500 – 1) × 2 again, where 6 is the 1st term and 2 is the common difference. You can see that if you follow the above pattern to obtain the nth term Tn of the arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d, you obtain Tn = a + (n – 1) d. In this formula, according to our notation, Tn denotes the nth term. Hence, the nth term Tn of the arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d is given by The importance of this formula is that it gives the relationship between the four unknowns a, d, n and Tn. This formula can be used to find the value of any one of the four unknowns when the values of the other 3 unknowns in an arithmetic progression are known. Now let us consider how problems on arithmetic progressions are solved using this formula.  Example 1 (Finding Tn when a, d and n are known) Find the 15th term of the arithmetic progression 3, 7, 11, 15.... Here, a = 3, d = 7 – 3 = 4, n = 15. Substitute these values in Tn = a + (n – 1)d to get  T15 = 3 + (15 – 1) × 4 = 3 + 56 = 59   Example 2 (Finding a when d, n and Tn are known) Find the first term of the arithmetic progression with common difference 4 and 26th term equal to 105. Here, d = 4 and Tn = 105 when n = 26. Substituting these in Tn = a + (n – 1) d we get, T26 = a + (26 – 1) × 4  105 = a + (26 – 1) × 4  105 – 100 = a  a = 5 Therefore the first term is 5.   
Find the common difference of the arithmetic progression with 1st term – 32 and 12th term 1. Here, a = –32 and Tn = 1 when n = 12 Substituting these in  d = 3 Therefore the common difference is 3. Find which term is – 65 in the arithmetic progression 30" 25" 10" ''' Here, a = 30" d = – 5" Tn = – 65 Substituting these in Tn = a + (n – 1) d,  – 65 = 30 × (n – 1) × (– 5)  – 65 = 30 – 5n + 5  – 65 – 35 = –5n 64 For free distribution      For an arithmetic progression, when the values of 2 unknowns out of a, d, n and Tn are not given, the values of these two unknowns can be found by solving two simultaneous equations, when sufficient information has been provided. Example 5 The 7th and 12th terms of an arithmetic progression are 38 and 63 respectively.  (ii) the 20th term. (i) Since Tn = 38 when n = 7 and Tn = 63 when n = 12 , we get, by substituting in  Tn = a + (n – 1) d, T12 = a + (12 – 1) × d 63 = a + 11d T7= a + (7 – 1) × d 38 = a + 6d Now, let us solve 1 and 2 2 – 1 gives  63 – 38 = a + 11d – (a + 6d)  25 = a + 11d – a – 6d  
 
 
 
 
 
 25 = 5d  5 = d  38 – 30 = a  a = 8  progression, let us substitute a = 8, d = 5 and n = 20 in Tn = a + (n – 1) d.  T20 = 8 + (20 – 1) × 5  = 8 + 19 × 5  = 8 + 95  = 103  the 20th term is 103. Example 6 In a certain sequence, the nth term Tn is given by Tn = 3n + 4.  (i) Write down the first 4 terms of this sequence. (ii) Write down an expression for the (n – 1)th term of this sequence and hence  show that this is an arithmetic progression. (iii) Which term is 169 in this arithmetic progression?         When n = 1, T1 = 3 × 1 + 4 = 7 When n = 2, T2 = 3 × 2 + 4 = 10 When n = 3, T3 = 3 × 3 + 4 = 13 When n = 4, T4 = 3 × 4 + 4 = 16   (ii) Replacing n by n – 1 in Tn = 3n + 4, we get  Tn – 1 = 3 (n – 1) + 4  = 3n – 3 + 4  = 3n + 1    = 3 = constant  the sequence is an arithmetic progression. (iii) It is given that Tn = 169.  Substituting in Tn = 3n + 4, we get 169 = 3n + 4  (iv) If there is a term with value 95, then there should be a positive integer n  such that Tn = 95. Then, 95 = 3n + 4 3n = 95 – 4 = 91                                       Exercise 24.1 1.

When we have to find the sum of a large number of terms, this lengthy way of adding all the terms one by one is a tedious task. In order to overcome this problem, let us derive a formula that can be used to find the sum of the initial terms of an arithmetic progression. Considering the above example, we rewrite S8 = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 and again by reversing the terms we write S8 = 17 + 15 + 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 Now from 1 and 2 we may write, rearranging the terms,  2 S8 = (3 + 17) + (5 + 15) + (7 + 13) + (9 + 11) + (11 + 9) + (13 + 7) + (15 + 5)  + (17 + 3)  2 S8 = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20  2 S8 = 8 × 20 (there are 8 terms of 20)   = 80 We may illustrate the above method as follows. There are 8 terms in the progression. The first term and the last term add to 20. The second and the penultimate term add to 20. Continuing this, we see that the sum of the first 8 terms of the progression is a sum of 4 pairs. The number of such pairs is one half the total number of terms to be added. Then the sum of all the terms is the product, Now, let us derive a formula using the above process, for the sum of the first n terms, Sn, of an arithmetic progression with first term a, common difference d and last (nth) term l. We may write, 20 20 20 20     Sn = a + ( a + d ) + ( a + 2d ) + ( a + 3d ) + ... ( l – 2d ) + ( l – d ) + l and then reversing the terms, Sn = l + ( l – d ) + ( l – 2d ) + ( l – 3d ) + ... ( a + 2d ) + ( a + d ) + a Now 1 and 2 gives  2 Sn = ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ... ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) + ( a + l ) As an example, let us find using the above formula, the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. The relevant progression is 1" 2" 3" 4" '''98" 99" 100, where a = 1, l = 100 and n = 100. The above formula can be used to find the sum of an arithmetic progression given the first term (a), the number of terms (n) and the last term (l). Now we derive a formula for the sum, given the first term (a), the number of terms (n) and the common difference (d). we substitute for l, which is actually Tn, the nth term given by Tn = a + (n – 1) d. we then get, Therefore, to find the sum Sn of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d, use the formula                      As an example, let us find the sum of the first 30 terms of the arithmetic progression 2, 4, 6, 8, ...

Find its sum if the common difference is – 5. Here a = 70, l = 2, and d = – 4. First we have to find the number of terms in the progression. Using the formula . the sum of the terms of the series is 648  is in 4 unknowns, namely Sn, n, a and l. Whenever three of these unknowns are given, the remaining unknown can be found by using the formula. The case for the formula The first term, the last term and the sum of all the terms of an arithmetic progression are 12, 99 and 1665 respectively. Find the number of terms, the common difference and the sum of the first 15 terms. Finally, in order to find the sum of the first 15 terms, substitute n = 15, a = 12, d = 3 in   How many terms (starting from the 1st term) of the arithmetic progression 13, 11, 9, ..., add to 40? Substitute a = 13, d = –2 , Sn = 40. Note( Here there are two acceptable solutions for n. Sum of the first four terms when n is 4 = 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 = 40 Sum of the first ten terms when n is 10 or or Here, both values are acceptable. Therefore 4 or 10 terms can be taken for the sum to be 40.  (i) a = 2, l = 62 and n = 31  (ii) a = 95, l = 10 and n = 12  , d =  (iii) a = 2.

Nimal who constructed a rectangular structure of breadth 5 cm as shown in the figure using a 30 cm long piece of wire, saved a small piece of the wire.

Solve the inequalities x + 3 > 1 and  a number line.      Example 2 Solve the inequality values that x can take. 3. Rs. 100 is sufficient to buy 3 mangoes and 2 mandarins. If the price of a mango is Rs. 20 and the price of a mandarin is taken to be Rs. y, then an inequality  in y can be written. Solve this inequality and find the maximum 2. Solve each of the following inequalities and write down the set of integral  solutions of the inequality.      The points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and K and the straight line L drawn parallel to the y axis are represented on the Cartesian plane given in the figure. y 4 G 3 ² The x coordinate of the points that lie on the line L is equal to 3. ² Therefore the straight line L is named x = 3. ² The x coordinate of any point that lies on the straight line x = 3 is equal to 3. Nimal who placed a 1 kg standard weight in one pan of a balance scale, placed a 500 g standard weight and three cakes of soap of the same type on the other pan. He observed that the pan with the 1 kg standard weight dipped below the other pan. If the mass of a cake of soap is taken as p grammes, an inequality p in terms of p can be written. Find the maximum integral value that the mass of a cake of soap can be.      2 –3 –1 –2 ² Therefor the region to the right of the straight line L is named x >3. ² The x coordinate of any point that belongs to the region x >3 is greater than 3. ² Therefore the region to the left of the straight line L is named x < 3. ² The x coordinate of any point that belongs to the region x < 3 is less than 3. It is clear that the Cartesian plane illustrated in the above example is divided into three specific regions, namely x < 3, x = 3 and x >3 by the straight line x = 3. Now let us see how these regions are represented in a Cartesian plane.  The region x < 3    The straight line x = 3 is indicated by a dashed line. This means that the points such that x = 3 do not belong to the region x < 3. The line x = 3 has been indicated by a thick line. This means that both the regions x < 3 and x = 3 belong to the shaded region. Therefore this region is named x ≤ 3.      A few more examples to illustrat the regions on a Cartesian plane separated by a line parallel to the x axis are given below.  y > 2   Exercise 25.2 1.

Write the two inequalities relevant to the shaded region.          The points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and M and the straight line L are represented on the Cartesian plane given in the figure. y 4 –3 –2 –2  –2 –4 Now let us see how a few more inequalities are represented on a Cartesian plane.  (i) y > x       What is meant by indicating y = x by a dashed line is that the points satisfying y = x do not belong to the shaded region y > x. What is meant by indicating y = x by a thick line is that the points satisfying y = x belong to the shaded region y ≥ x.                            2. Which of the following points belong to the region  A = (5, 5) B= (–3, –2) C = (0, –1) Data collected through a survey on the number of family members that reside in each of the houses in a certain housing scheme is given below.  4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 8, 9, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6, 3 8, 4, 5, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5, 4, 2, 4, 5, 3, 5, 7 5, 5, 7, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 4, 5, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4 The greatest value of this data set is 9 and the least value is 2. The value that is obtained when the least value is subtracted from the greatest value is defined as the range. When the range of a data set is small, as in the above case, the information related to the data can be tabulated as follows. A table of the following form is called a frequency distribution. Number of family members residing in the house Frequency (Number of families) 12 14 Information on the marks obtained for mathematics at the term test by the grade 10 students of a certain school is given below.             25" 12" 65" 40" 32" 84" 52" 65" 32" 09 70" 53" 67" 56" 65" 48" 20" 17" 08" 43 52" 68" 73" 25" 39" 42" 61" 22" 37" 45 36" 65" 24" 53" 46" 18" 39" 54" 26" 35 27" 94" 59" 87" 72 In this case, the greatest value is 94 while the least value is 8. Accordingly, the range of the data set = 94 – 8  = 86 Since the range of this data set is large, if we tabulate this information under each value from 8 to 94, we will obtain a very long table.      When the range of the data set is large, as in the above case, it is convenient to divide the data into groups and tabulate the information. A frequency distribution prepared by separating the above data into class intervals is given below.  8 - 16 17 - 25 26 - 34 35 - 43 44 - 52 53 - 61 62 - 70 71 - 79 80 - 88 89 - 97 What is meant by stating that the frequency of the class interval 8 - 16 is 3, is that there are 3 values (data) that lie in the interval from 8 to 16. The greatest frequency of this distribution is 8. It corresponds to the class interval 35 - 43. This class interval is named the modal class. A frequency distribution such as the above which is expressed using class intervals is called a grouped frequency distribution. When preparing a grouped frequency distribution, the class intervals are formed so that there are about 10 class intervals. Observe that all the class intervals in this example are of the same size.That is, the size of each class interval is 9.           The initial class interval of this distribution is 8 - 16, and the next class interval is 17 -25. The relevant data are test marks. Since there are no marks between 16 and 17, the class intervals have been organized such that when the first class interval ends with 16, the next class interval starts with 17. Now let us consider how the mean of a grouped frequency distribution such as the above distribution is found. For this, the mid-value of each class interval has to be found first. Accordingly, the mid-value of the class interval 8 – 16 is 12. The mid-value of a class interval is found by adding together the upper value and the lower value of the class interval and then dividing this sum by 2. The mid-value of every class interval can be found in this manner. The mid-value of a class interval is considered as the representative value of the data in that class interval when calculations are performed. 8 - 16 17 - 25 26 - 34 35 - 43 44 - 52 53 - 61 62 - 70 71 - 79 80 - 88 89 - 97 12 21 30 39 48 57 66 75 84 93 A grouped frequency distribution prepared with the data collected on the ages of the staff members in a certain office is given below. Age of the staff member (Years) Number of staff members Let us recall how the class intervals were written in the example discussed earlier on the mathematics marks of the grade 10 students. The first class interval was writ- ten as 8 – 16 and the second class interval was written as 17 – 25. Since there were no marks between 16 and 17, it was appropriate to separate the class intervals in this manner. However in this example, the first class interval is written as 20 – 25, and the second class interval is written as 25 – 30. That is, the second class interval starts with the same value that the first class interval ends. The reason for this is because the data collected here are the ages of people. Since there can be people whose ages lies between 25 and 26 years, the second class interval should com- mence with the value with which the previous class interval ended. The ages 20 or greater but less than 25 belong to the class interval 20 – 25. Accordingly the age 25 years belongs to the class interval 25 – 30 years. Data such as length, weight, etc,. Which can take any value within a range are called continuous data. Data such as no.of students, marks, etc,. Which take only integral values are called discrete data. Given below is the grouped frequency distribution of the ages of the staff members, together with the mid-values of the class intervals. 22.5 27.5 32.5 37.5 42.5 47.5 52.5 57.5 20 - 25 25 - 30 30 - 35 35 - 40 40 - 45 45 - 50 50 - 55 55 - 60 11 - 20 21 - 30 31 - 40 41 - 50 51 - 60 61 - 70 71 - 80 81 - 90 91 - 100  (i) Complete the mid-value column.

(ii) By using the table, find the number of children in the class whose heights are When calculating the mean of grouped data, the mid-value of a class interval is taken as the value which represents the whole class interval. Let us now consider how the mean of grouped data is calculated using the mid-values. number of students who were present in a certain school during the first term is given below. Class Interval (Number who were present)  Frequency (Number of days) 531 - 550 551 - 570 571 - 590 591 - 610 611 - 630 4 10 21 12 10  (i) Copy the table and complete the mid-value column.  (ii) On how many days were there less than 591 students present?  (iii) On how many days were there more than 570 students present?  (iv) How many days was the school in session during the given term? 100 - 200 200 - 300 300 - 400 400 - 500 500 - 600 600 - 700 5 12 25 30 16 12  (i) Copy the table and complete the mid-value column.  (ii) How many bulbs burned out in less than 400 hours?  (iii) How many bulbs were used to conduct this test?  (Assume that the number of hours each bulb that was used remained lit was  between 100 hours and 700 hours)  The following grouped frequency distribution gives the marks that 40 students received out of 25 on a mathematics test. Class Interval (Marks) By using the above information, let us construct a table which contains a mid-value column and a column consisting of the product of the mid-values and the corresponding frequencies. Here x denotes the mid-value and f denotes the frequency. 18 70 210 198 88 Frequency  f 15 11 4 04 - 08 08 - 12 12 - 16 16 - 20 20 - 24 x 6 10 14 18 22 Here, Σf denotes the total number of children, fx denotes the product of the mid-value x and the relevant frequency f, and Σfx denotes the sum of the values in the fx column.Then the mean is defined by That is,      1. A frequency distribution prepared using the data on the quantity of beans that was brought to a certain vegetable collection centre on a certain day by 40 farmers is given below. This information was obtained through a survey conducted on the quantities of vegetables that are brought to the vegetable collection centre by farmers.  (i) Calculate the mean quantity of beans that was brought by the farmers.  (ii) Accordingly, what is the quantity of beans that can be expected to be brought  (i) What is the size of a class interval?  (ii) What is the modal class?  (iii) Find the mean mark obtained by a student in the class.  The class intervals of a grouped frequency distribution may sometimes contain large mid-values. In such situations, finding the mean using the above method may not be easy. Let us consider a more suitable method of finding the mean of a distribution of this type, through an example. That is, by considering a simple example, let us explain how the mean is calculated using the assumed mean. Example 1 The following table contains data on the number of units of water that was consumed during a month by 70 families who receive water from a certain water scheme. Class interval Number of families  Age (Years)  (i) How many teachers are serving in this educational division? (ii) To which age group does the most number of teachers belong? (iii) Calculate the mean age of a teacher serving in this educational division based  Circumference of a tree trunk (cm) Frequency  (i) Find the modal class of this distribution.  (ii) Using the above information, calculate the mean circumference of a tree trunk Calculate the mean number of water units that was consumed by a family, to the nearest whole number. Let us first find the mid-values which represent each of the class intervals. Let us now assume that the mid-value 22 of the class interval 21 – 23 is the mean. That is, let us take 22 to be the assumed mean. Now let us find the deviation of each mid-value from the assumed mean by subtracting the assumed mean from each mid-value. 1 26 11 8 Deviation d Frequency  f 12 - 14 15 - 17 18 - 20 21 - 23 24 - 26 27 - 29 13 16 19 22 25 28 Here Σf denotes the total number of families, fd the product of the deviation and the corresponding frequency, and Σfd the sum of the values in the fd column. It is easy to find the deviations by taking the assumed mean to be either the mid-value of the modal class or the mid-value of the median class.    If the assumed mean is denoted by A and the deviations are denoted by d, then the mean of the frequency distribution is given by A  Number of viewers  (i) What is the modal class of the above frequency distribution?  (ii) Find the number of viewers whose ages are less than 25 years, as a  percentage of the total number of viewers.

(iii) If this pattern of sales is expected to continue during the next two months too, estimate the amount of rice that should be stored to be sufficient for the next 60 days.

(ii) Find the mean mark of a student in each group by taking the mid-value of the Number of electricity units Number of households  (i) What is the modal class of this distribution? (ii) Find the mean number of electricity units used by a household during this month, by taking the assumed mean to be the mid-value of the class interval 61 – 70. (iii) When the number of electricity units used lies in the interval 61 – 90, the Electricity Board charges Rs.14 per unit. Accordingly, what is the income that the Electricity Board can expect to earn from these 100 households during that month? 7.

The following table contains information on the speed of the vehicles that passed a certain location during a period of two hours.

(iii) Find the mean speed of a vehicle which passes this location by taking the A straight line segment drawn from the centre of a circle to a point on the circle is called a radius (Observe the above figure). The length of this line segment is the same irrespective of the point on the circumference that is selected. Therefore, such a line segment is called the radius of the circle. The length of the radius is also called the radius. A chord which passes through the centre of the circle is called a diameter. All the diameters of a circle are equal in length. This length is also called the diameter. A diameter is the longest chord of a circle. The length of a diameter is twice the length of the radius. • On a piece of paper, construct a circle of radius 3 cm using a pair of compasses and name its centre as O. Draw a chord AB which is not a diameter of the circle. • By measuring the length using a ruler, mark the midpoint of the chord as C and • solve problems by using the theorem that the straight line joining the midpoint of a chord of a circle to the centre is perpendicular to the chord, and       Discuss what you learnt through this activity with the other students in the class. The relationship that was identified is a theorem related to the chords of a circle. AB is a chord of a circle with centre O and radius 5 cm. The midpoint of AB is C. If AB = 8 cm, find the length of OC. Let us represent this information in a figure.  with the aid of a protractor. Observe that this angle is 90o, that is, that OC and AB are perpendicular to each other. • Draw several more chords of different lengths within this circle itself and observe that the straight line joining the midpoint of each chord to the centre is perpendicular to the respective chord.   Theorem The straight line joining the centre of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.       (Since the straight line joining the centre of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord) . .. OCB is a right angled triangle. Let us find the length of OC by applying Pythagoras’ theorem. Also  OB2 = OC2 + CB2 (Pythagoras’ theorem) (Since the straight line joining the centre of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord)    2. PQ is a chord of a circle with centre O. The midpoint of the chord is R. If PQ=12 cm and OR = 8 cm, find the radius of the circle. 3.

Find the perimeter of the quadrilateral OXBY. O x x O x O     27.2 The formal proof of the theorem that “the straight line joining the midpoint of a chord of a circle to the centre is perpendicular to the chord” To be proved: OX is perpendicular to AB. Construction: Join OA, OB.  Proof : In the triangles OXA and OXB,  AO = BO (Radii of the same circle)  AX = XB (Since X is the midpoint of AB)  OX is a common side. AB and BC are two chords of a circle with centre O which are perpendicular to each other. The mid-points of AB and BC are X and Y respectively. If AB = 8 cm and BC = 6 cm, find the perimeter of the quadrilateral BXOY. 5. The vertices P, Q and R of the triangle PQR lie on a circle with centre O. The midpoints of PQ and QR are A and B respectively. If PQ = 16 cm, OA = 6 cm and calculate the length of QR.          AB and CD are two equal chords of a circle of centre O. The midpoints of AB and CD are X and Y respectively. Show that OX = OY. To show that OX = OY, let us first show that the two triangles OXB and OYC are congruent to each other under the conditions of hypotenuse-side. In the triangles OXB and OYC, since X is the midpoint of AB and Y is the midpoint of CD, Therefore, since X and Y are the midpoints of the chords AB and CD, we obtain XB = YC.

Several examples of loci that can be observed in our environment are given below. 1. The path of a fruit which falls from a tree. 2. The path of the pointed end of a clock hand. 3. The path of a planet orbiting around the sun. 4. The path of a pendulum in a pendulum clock. 5. The path of a ball that is hit by a bat. In this lesson we will only be considering loci in a plane. Note: Before considering the construction of loci, direct your attention to the following facts. 1. Distance between two points: Let us consider two points A and B that lie on a plane. What is meant by the distance between the two points is the length of the straight line segment joining the two points. 2. Distance from a point to a straight line: Let us consider a given point A and a given straight line. What is meant by the distance from A to the straight line is the shortest distance from A to the straight line. This shortest distance is the perpendicular distance from A to the straight line. By studying this lesson you will be able to • construct the four basic loci • construct parallel lines • construct triangles with the given information.       3. Distance between two parallel lines Consider the following two parallel lines. Let us consider any point A on one of the lines. The perpendicular distance from A to the other straight line is said to be the distance between the two lines. Since the two lines are parallel, irrespective of where the point A is located on the line, this distance remains the same. The pointed end of each hand on the clock face in the figure is always located at a constant distance from the centre of the clock, which is the location at which the hand is fixed to the clock. You will be able to observe when the clock is working, that the path of the pointed end of each hand is a circle. The point where the hands are fixed to the clock is the centre of these circles, and the radius of each circle is the length of the relevant hand. Observe here that the pointed end of each hand is travelling at a constant distance from a fixed point. That particular constant distance is the length of the hand. 10 9 8 Let us see how a circle is constructed. Mark a point. Take the radius of the circle that you want to construct to the pair of compasses using the ruler and keep the point of the pair of compasses on the point you marked. Now draw the circle. 2. Constructing the locus of a point moving at an equal distance from two fixed As shown in the figure, the point P is at an equal distance from the two points A and B. Further, Q is another point which is at an equal distance from A and B. There are a large number of points such as these, which are at an equal distance from A and B. Observe what is obtained when all these points are joined together.    It is clear that the straight line that is obtained when all these points are joined together, passes through the midpoint of the line joining A and B, and is perpendicular to AB. Now let us consider how this locus, that is, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB is constructed. Mark two points and name them as A and B. Step 1: Draw the line segment AB. On the pair of compasses, take a length which is a little more than half the length of AB, and taking A and B as the centres and the length on the pair of compasses as the radius, draw two arcs which intersect each other (as shown in the figure). Step 2: Name the intersection points of the two arcs as C and D and draw the straight line which passes through these two points. This straight line is the required locus. A The figure illustrates a pair of straight lines drawn parallel to the straight line AB on opposite sides of AB. Each of these lines is at a constant distance of 2 cm from AB. Conversely, if a point lies at a distance of 2 cm from AB, then it is clear that this point must lie on one of the above two lines. Q 116 For free distribution The locus of a point moving at an equal distance from two fixed points is the perpendicular bisector of the straight line joining the two points.                                                                           Accordingly, the locus of a point which lies 2 cm from the straight line AB is one of two straight lines which are parallel to AB and lie on opposite sides of AB 2 cm from it. Now let us consider how a pair of lines parallel to a given straight line, which is the locus under consideration, is constructed.  A Draw a straight line segment using a straight edge. Select two points A and B on this straight line. Step 2: On each of these two perpendicular lines, mark two points at the required distance (say 5 cm), on either side of the given straight line, and name them P, Q, R and S as shown in the figure.  Step 3: Draw the straight lines PQ and RS. These two straight lines are the required locus.  The locus of a point moving at a constant distance from a given straight line is a line parallel to the given straight line, at the given constant distance from the straight line, which may lie on either side of the straight line.                                                                                   The straight lines AB and CD in the figure intersect at O. The straight line PQ has been drawn such that ) is the angle divided into two equal angles. The line PQ is called the bisector of the angle ). Similarly, the straight line RS has been drawn such that the angle (and the angle Can you see that the distance from any point on the line PQ to the lines AB and CD is equal? Understand that similarly, the distance from any point on the line RS to the lines AB and CD is also equal. Do you see that conversely, if a point is at an equal distance from the lines AB and CD, then it must lie on either PQ or RS? Let the two straight lines AB and CD intersect at the point O. Step 1: Using the pair of compasses, draw an arc with centre O such that it intersects both BA and DC. Name the two points at which the arc intersects BA and DC as E and F respectively. xx xx O The locus of a point moving at an equal distance from two intersecting straight lines is a bisector of the angle formed at the intersection point of the lines.    Step 2: Using the pair of compasses and taking E and F as centres, draw two intersecting arcs. Step 3: Name the point of intersection of the two arcs as G, and draw the straight line which passes through the points O and G. Construct the other angle bisector in a similar manner. A G 2.

Now let us learn how to construct parallel lines using a straight edge and a pair of compasses. Method 1 Let us assume that the straight line is AB and the external point is C. Step 3: Taking the same radius, (that is, without changing the position of the pair of compasses), draw another arc with C as the centre, such that it intersects AC produced at S as shown in the figure. Step 5: Draw the straight line CD such that is passes through the point R.

(iii) Measure and write down the magnitude of       Method 2 Let us assume that the straight line is AB and the external point is C. Step 5: Draw the straight line CD such that is passes through the point R. Since the angle  are alternate angles which are equal to each other, the straight lines AB and DC are parallel to each other. B For free distribution    Method 3 Let us assume that the straight line is AB and the external point is C. Step 2: Draw another arc with centre P and the same radius as that of the previous arc (i.e., keeping the radius CP unchanged), such that it intersects AB. Name the intersection point as Q. Step 4: Now draw another arc with centre C and the same radius as before, such that it intersects the arc in step 3. Name the intersection point of the arcs as R. Do the following activity to further understand about constructions related to parallel lines. 1. Construct an angle of 60o and name the vertex as A. On one arm (side) of the angle mark point B such that AB = 8 cm. Mark point C on the other arm (side) such that AC = 5 cm. Now using the pair of compasses complete the parallelogram ABDC. 2. Draw two parallel lines such that the distance between the lines is 4 cm. Mark the points A and B on one line such that AB = 7 cm. Mark point D on the other line so that AD is 5 cm. Now complete the parallelogram ABCD.    4. Construct a rectangle of length 6.5 cm and breadth 4 cm. Name it as ABCD.

Draw two parallel lines such that the distance between the lines is 4 cm. Mark the points A and B on one line such that AB is 7 cm. Mark point C on the other line such that BC = 5 cm. Now mark point D on the same line which C is on, such that CD = 4 cm. Then complete the quadrilateral ABCD and observe that it is a trapezium. The cross sections of the solids given above are uniform, and the plane surfaces at the two ends are parallel to each other. Solids having such shapes are defined in general as cylinders. Circular plane surfaces The cylinder in the figure has two circular plane surfaces at the top and the bottom. Apart from these, it also has a curved surface. The radii of the two circular plane surfaces are equal to each other. Therefore, the areas of these two plane surfaces are equal. The straight line joining the centres of these two circles is called the axis of the cylinder. Any straight line on the curved surface which is parallel to the axis of the cylinder is called a generator of the cylinder. The axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the two circular plane surfaces. Therefore, such a cylinder is called a right circular cylinder. (There are cylinders which are not right circular. However such cylinders will not be discussed here.) What is meant by the term “right” is that the axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the two plane surfaces. What is meant by the term “circular” is that any cross section which is perpendicular to the axis is circular in shape. The radius of a plane face of the cylinder is usually denoted by r and the length of the axis is usually denoted by h. The radius r of the circular faces is called the radius of the cylinder and the length of the axis h is called the height of the cylinder. 128 For free distribution By studying this lesson you will be able to  • calculate the surface area and volume of a right circular cylinder  • calculate the surface area and volume of a right triangular prism  When the radius and the height of a cylinder are given, the areas of the three surface parts of the cylinder need to be added together to obtain the total surface area. The areas of the two circular faces at the two ends can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle. A mechanism such as the following can be used to calculate the area of the curved surface When the curved surface of the cylinder is cut along a generator as shown in the figure and opened out, a rectangle is obtained. The length of one side of this rectangle is equal to the height (h) of the cylinder while the length of the other side is equal to the perimeter of one of its circular plane faces. The area of this rectangle is equal to the area of the curved surface of the cylinder. Accordingly, an expression for the curved surface of the cylinder can be developed in the following manner. Now we can find the total surface area of the cylinder in the following manner. Area of curved Total surface area surface of the cylinder Area of top + face   Area of bottom face      Note: (i) Exterior surface area of a cylinder without a lid = πr2 + 2 πrh (ii) Exterior surface area of a cylinder without a base or a lid = 2 πrh Let us now consider several solved problems related to the surface area of a cylinder.

The properties given below are common to the solids illustrated in the above figure. ² The cross section is uniform. ² The cross section takes the shape of a polygon. ² The side faces are rectangles. ² The faces at the two ends are perpendicular to the side faces. Solids with these properties are called right prisms. From these right prisms, we will pay further attention to the one with a triangular cross section. The figure illustrates a right prism with a triangular cross section.

The possible results are either 'heads' or 'tails'. However we cannot say with certainty what the outcome will be before observing it. Experiments in which we know the possible outcomes, but cannot say with certainty which outcome will occur are called random experiments. The set to which all the possible outcomes of a random experiment belong is called 'the sample space'. It is denoted by S. The following table shows some examples for random experiments and the relevant sample spaces. Consider the random experiment of rolling a fair tetrahedronal die numbered from 1 to 4 and recording the result. The sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Some subsets of this sample space are {3}, {2, 4}, {1, 2, 3}. These subsets can be explained as follows: {3} denotes ''The event of getting 3 as the result". {2, 4} denotes "The event of getting 2 or 4 as the result". • identify simple events and composite events • find the probability of events which are not mutually exclusive • find the probability of an event using a grid or a tree diagram    Also if "getting a number less than 4" is denoted by A, then it can be written as A = {1, 2, 3}. the sample space is S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6}. Let us write some events relevant to the sample space. {1}, {2}, {3}, {1" 3}, {2" 4}, {1" 3" 5}, {2" 3" 5}, {3" 4" 5" 6} In the above events, {1}, {2} and {3} consist of only one outcome each. Such events are called simple events. Thus, {5}, {6} are simple events. Events which are not simple are called composite events. The events {1" 3}, {2" 4}, {1" 3" 5} are composite events. These composite events can be further decomposed into subsets. Because the coin is unbiased, it is clear that the likelihood of getting either of these two outcomes is equal. Let us consider another example. There are 3 identical balls in a bag coloured red, white and black. Consider taking out one ball at random. The sample space is shown below. Because the balls are identical, it is clear that the likelihood of taking any one of the balls is equal. If each of the outcomes in a random experiment has an equal likelihood of occuring, that experiment is called an experiment with equally likely outcomes. 144 For free distribution    Consider the experiment of "tossing an unbiased coin." As you have learnt in earlies grades, the probability of each equally likely outcome "getting heads" and "getting tails" in the sample space is Now let us consider a random experiment which is not an experiment with equally likely outcomes. Amara planted a mango seed and observed whether a plant would grow within a week. The sample space is In an instance where all the outcomes of a sample space are equally likely to occur, the probability of an event occuring is defined as below. Let us denote the number of elements in the sample space S by n (S) and the number of elements in the event A by n (A). The probability of A occuring is denoted by P(A). Then With reference to an experiment in which a card is drawn randomly from a bag containing 5 identical cards numbered from 1 to 5,  (i) write the sample space and find n(S).  (ii) write the elements of A and find n(A) if A is the event of getting an even  number  (iii) find the probability P(A) that an even number is drawn.  (i) S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5}. . .. n (S) = 5  (ii) A = {2" 4}. . .. n (A) = 2 Here there are no reasons to assume that the outcomes are equally likely. Here, taking the probability of a plant growing as Probability of the event occuring Number of elements in the event Number of elements in the sample space      In an experiment of rolling an unbiased die with its faces marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  (i) find the probability that the number shown is 4.  (ii) find the probability that the number shown is odd. (iii) find the probability that the number is greater than 2. The sample space is S = {1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6}. Thus n(S) = 6. Since there are three (1, 3 and 5) odd numbers, the probability of getting an odd number Since there are four (3, 4, 5 and 6) numbers greater than 2, the probability of getting a number greater than  (b) Write 5 simple events in the event A. 146 For free distribution 1. Write down the sample space for each of the following random experiments.  (i) Recording the card drawn from a pack of 10 identical cards numbered 1 to 10. (ii) A circular disk is divided into three identical sectors, one of which is coloured red, another blue and the other yellow. A pointer is fixed to the center of the disk and the disk is spun. The colour of the sector at which it stops is recorded. (iii) Recording the number of runs scored by a batsman in a single delivery in a 2. Determine whether each event given below is a simple or a composite event.  (i) When rolling a tetrahedronal die numbered 1 to 4,  (a) getting the number 3  (ii) In a pack of 5 identical cards labelled A, B, C, D and E,  (a) drawing the card labelled A 3.When randomly taking a card from a bag containing 8 identical cards numbered  1 to 8,  (a) if the event of getting a card with a number greater than 4 is A, then write If A and B are two events, then their intersection also events. For example, suppose there are 5 identical balls numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and one is picked at random. Then, If we denote the event of picking a ball with a number greater than 2 as A, A = {3, 4, 5}' If we denote the event of picking an even numbered ball as B, B = {2" 4}' Then, sets A and B; that is, a ball with an even number greater than 2. Furthermore,  denotes the event of picking a ball  = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Here, in either set A or in set B; that is, a ball with either an even number or a number greater than 2.  (i) Write the sample space.  (ii) If the event of drawing a square number is X, then write the elements of X randomly.  (i) Write the sample space.  (ii) Find the probability of drawing a red bead.  (iii) Find the probability of drawing a blue bead. Brand A Brand B Mango Flavoured 2 3 Orange Flavoured 1 2  (i) an orange flavoured toffee  (iii) a toffee of brand B  (v) an orange flavoured toffee of brand B   (ii) a toffee of brand A  (iv) a mango flavoured toffee of brand A  Now let us consider a relationship between the events A, B, A and B are any two events in a sample space with equally likely outcomes. Since the outcomes are equally likely, Thus, for any two events A and B in a sample space with equally likely outcomes, we have      A fair tetrahedronal die with its sides numbered from 1 to 4 is rolled. Let us denote the event that it rests on an even numbered face by A and the event that it rests on an odd numbered face by B. That is, A = {2, 4} and B = {1, 3}. Then O. This means that A and B have no common elements. That is, these two events do not occur together. Such events are said to be mutually exclusive events. Now, let us find given information in a Venn diagram. There is a pack of 5 identical cards numbered from 1 to 5. Consider the random experiment of drawing a card randomly. The sample space here is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. If A is the event of drawing an even numbered card, then A = {2, 4}.    If the event of A not happening, that is, the event of not drawing an even numbered card is B, then, B = {1, 3, 5}. In the above experiment, if the event of drawing an even numbered card is A, then the event of drawing a card which is not even numbered is the complement of A. The complement of A is written as A . Therefore A = {1, 3, 5}. Therefore, These results are true for any event.  1. In a random experiment of rolling a fair die numbered from 1 to 6, let  A be the event that a prime number is obtained,  B be the event that a perfect square is obtained,  C be the event that a number greater than 4 is obtained and  D be the event that a multiple of 6 is obtained.  Select all pairs of mutually exclusive events.        Consider a random experiment of tossing two unbiased identical coins A and B simultaneously. Let us denote the heads by H and the tails by T. The set of all possible outcomes of this experiment can be listed as follows: Getting heads in both coins, (H, H) Getting heads in coin A and tails in coin B, (H, T) Getting tails in coin A and heads in coin B, (T, H) Getting tails in both coins, (T, T) Accordingly, the sample space can be written as {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}. This sample space can be represented in a grid as follows: T  coin A The sample space of this experiment consists of four outcomes. Since the coins are unbiased and identical, all the possible outcomes are equally likely and thus the following probabilities are obtained:  (i) Find  (ii) There by show that X and Y are mutually exclusive.     Note: In the above random experiment all the outcomes were equally likely. Even though it is not compulsory to represent the outcomes in a grid, finding the probability by this method is not possible when the outcomes are not equally likely. Let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin and rolling a tetrahedronal die numbered from 1 to 4, and recording the faces touching the table. (i) Show the sample space as a set of ordered pairs on a grid and then represent it (a) 1 on the die. (b) an even number on the die and tails on the coin. (c) 2 on the die and heads on the coin.  (a) In the above grid, the area marked by are the elements of the event of getting 1 on the die. There are 2 elements there. The total number of elements in the sample space is 8. ∴ 2 1 The probability of getting 1 on the die = 8 4= an even number on the die and tails on the coin. There are 2 such elements. ∴ 1 4= 2 8 2  tetrahedronal die getting two on the die and heads on the coin. There is one such element. The probability of getting two on the dice and heads on the coin            There are 5 identical balls numbered from 1 to 5 in a bag. A ball is taken from the bag randomly and the number is recorded. Then the ball is put back in the bag (with replacement) and again a ball is randomly taken for a second time and this number is also recorded. 3  1st ball       1. A fair die numbered from 1 to 6 is rolled and an unbiased coin is tossed at the same time. The side on top is recorded in each case. Consider this experiment.  (a) Show the sample space in a grid.  (b) Use it to find the probabilities of the following events.  (i) Getting 1 on the die and heads on the coin.  (ii) Getting an even number on the die and heads on the coin.  (iii) Getting tails on the coin. 2. Two fair dice numbered from 1 to 6 are rolled simultaneously and the side shown  (a) Show the sample space in a grid.  (b) Use it to find the probabilities of the following events.  (i) The sum of the two numbers being 5.  (ii) The sum of the two numbers being greater than 10.  (iii) The two numbers being the same.  (iv) Getting 3 on the first die. 3. A bag contains identical beads. There are 3 red beads, one blue bead, and 2 yellow beads. These are named R1, R2, R3, B, Y1, Y2. A bead is taken randomly, its colour is recorded and then put back in the bag. A bead is randomly taken from the bag again and its colour is recorded.  (a) Show the sample space in a grid.  (b) Use it to find the probabilities of the following events.  (i) The first bead being red and the second bead being yellow.  (ii) Both beads being red.  (iii) Both beads being the same colour.  (iv) Getting at least one blue bead. 4. There are 5 roads labelled A, B, C, D, and E that meet at a junction. Here, it is possible to enter or exit from any road. Draw a grid showing all the possible ways in which a person can enter and exit and find the probabilities of the following events. (Assume that all the possible outcomes are equally likely.)  (i) Entering from A and exiting from B.  (ii) Entering from A or B and exiting from D.  (iii) Entering from E  (iv) Entering and exiting from different roads.  Consider the following random experiments.  (i) Two unbiased coins are tossed simultaneously and the sides shown are recorded. It is clear that whatever the result of one coin toss is, it will not affect the result of the other. (ii) There are two bags containing some identical balls. One ball is taken randomly  from each bag. It is clear that the ball taken from one bag will not affect what  ball is taken from the other bag. (iii) During the germination of a few planted seeds, germination of one seed does  not have an impact on the germination of the other seeds. In this way, if one event does not affect another, the two events are called independent. The independence of two events is defined as follows. We have learnt that two mutually exclusive events are two events that do not occur together. But what is meant by 2 events being independent is that the occurrance of one event does not affect the occurrance of the other event. 5. A plant has 4 red flowers and 3 yellow flowers of identical shape and size. 2 butterflies, A and B, come to the flowers to drink nectar. It is possible for both to drink nectar from the same flower at the same time. Draw a grid of the sample space, showing all the possible ways the butterflies can pick flowers to get nectar and find the probabilities of the following events. (Assume that the butterflies pick flowers randomly.)  (i) Butterfly A picking a red flower and butterfly B picking a yellow flower.  (ii) Both butterflies picking flowers of the same colour.  (iii) Both butterflies picking flowers of different colours.  (iv) Both butterflies picking the same flower.   The probability that candidate A will pass an examination is that candidate B will pass is the probabilities of the events below.  (i) Both of them passing  (ii) One of them passing. Let us denote the event of candidate A passing as A and candidate B passing as B.  (i) The probability of both candidates A and B passing is Because they are independent events,   Take the event of the first coin being heads as A. Take the event of both the coins showing the same side as B. Two unbiased identical coins are tossed simultaneously. Let us represent the sample space of this random experiment in a grid. H  1st coin Here, the event of A or B does not affect the other event; therefore A and B are independent events. Let us find the probabilities relevant to A and B. That is, A and B are independent events. (i) Find P (Y).  (ii) Find X Y . 2. An unbiased coin and a fair die numbered from 1 to 6 are tossed simultaneously.  (a) Represent the sample space relevant to this experiment in a grid.  (b) Take the event of the coin showing heads as A and the event of the die showing the number 4 as B. Show these events on the grid and find the probabilities of the events below.  (ii) P (B)   
 Tree diagrams can be used to find the probabilities of events of a random experiment. Let us consider the following example in order to understand this method. An unbiased coin is tossed twice and in each case the outcomes is recorded. Draw the relevant tree diagram and find the probabilities of the following events.  (i) Getting heads both times.  (ii) Getting the same side both times.  (iii) Getting tails at least once.  (vi) Getting heads the second time. This experiment can be separated into two. That is, the first toss and the second toss. The two outcomes of the first toss can be represented in a tree diagram with two branches as shown below. probabilities are the tree diagram as given below. T H 3. A bag contains 3 red beads and 2 blue beads, all of which are otherwise identical. A bead is taken out randomly and its colour is recorded and then it is put back in the bag.

(ii) The first bead being blue and the second bead being red. (iii) The first bead being red and the second bead being blue. (iv) Both beads being blue.    All the possible outcomes are represented above. As the events given by the 1st and the 2nd attempts are independent, to find the P (Heads in the 1st attempt and tails in the 2nd attempt) = P (Tails in the 1st attempt and tails in the 2nd attempt) = 1 2 P (Tails in the 1st attempt and heads in the 2nd attempt) = 1 2 Sample space of the experiment {(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T) }         +  (Because the two events are mutually exclusive) 1.

(iv) Both taking leave on the same day. The circle in the figure is divided into two parts by the two points A and B on the circle. These two parts are called arcs. When the two points A and B are such that the straight line joining the two points passes through the centre of the circle, that is, when it is a diameter, then the two arcs are equal in length. When this is not the case, the two arcs are unequal in length. Then the shorter arc is called the minor arc and the longer arc is called the major arc. The angle  which is formed by joining the end points of the minor arc AB which is indicated by the thick line in the figure, to the centre, is defined as the angle subtended by the minor arc AB at the centre.  
 
 
 
 
The reflex angle which is formed by joining the end points of the major arc AB which is indicated by the thick line in the figure, to the centre, is defined as the angle subtended by the major arc AB at the centre.        Let us assume that C is any point on the major arc AB. The angle ACBˆ  is formed when the end points of the minor arc AB are joined to the point C on the major arc. That is, ACBˆ is the angle that is subtended by the minor arc AB on the remaining part of the circle.

Let us engage in the following activity to gain an understanding of the relationship between the angle subtended at the centre by an arc and the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the same arc. Draw a circle on a tissue paper and name its centre O. Mark two points on the circle such that a minor arc and a major arc are obtained. Name these two points as A and B.  4.

(ii) Write down for the minor arc BC,  (a) the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle  (b) the angle subtended at the centre.  ² Place this folded sector on You would have established the fact that the angle AOBˆ subtended at the centre by the minor arc AB is twice the angle subtended by this arc on the remaining part of the circle. In the same manner, mark arcs of different lengths on circles of varying radii and repeat this activity. Through these activities you would have observed that the angle subtended at the centre by an arc is twice the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the same arc. This result is given as a theorem below. Now, by considering the following examples, let us see how calculations are performed using the above theorem.

In the earlier grades, you used bearings and distances to indicate the position of a point on a horizontal plane. In this lesson, you will learn how to find the position of a point on a vertical plane by drawing a scale diagram using angles of elevation and angles of depression. An angle of elevation is defined as the angle formed between the line of vision and the eye level (horizontal level) of an observer when the observer is looking at an object above the eye level. An angle of depression is defined as the angle formed between the line of vision and the eye level (horizontal level) of an observer when the observer is looking at an object below the eye level.     When stating the position of an object in a vertical plane, we need to state the magnitude of the angle of elevation or depression. We may use a clinometer for the purpose of measuring these angles.   A simple clinometer can be made in the classroom as follows: • Cut out a semicircle with a radius of about 10 cm from a piece of cardboard. • Mark both ends of the curved edge as 90x and the middle of the curved edge as 0x. • Calibrate the curved edge in both directions from 0x, 10x by 10x as shown in the • Fix a straw along the straight edge of the semicircle. • Attach a small weight to one end of a piece of string longer than 10 cm and fix the When the straw is horizontal, the string goes through 0x. When the straw is inclined at an angle of 45x, for example, the string goes through 45x, in which case the straw shows a 45x vertical inclination. Angles of elevation and depression can be measured in this manner using a clinometer. Now let us consider several instances when scale diagrams are used to represent information in a vertical plane. The figure below shows a tree and its shadow on the ground. Let us draw a scale diagram using the given information and hence find the height of the tree. First we choose a suitable scale. Let 1 cm in the scale diagram represent an actual distance of 1 m. below using the clinometer you made.  (i) The top of the flagpole at your school.  (ii) The top of a building.  (iii) The top of a tree in your school. Accordingly, we need to draw a line segment of 6 cm to represent 6 m. Let us represent this by a horizontal line segment AB, (see the figure below). Now let us draw an angle of 50x at B and complete the triangle ABC such that BAC  = 90x as shown in the figure. C Now in the scale diagram, AC represents the height of the tree and you can measure and find that the length of AC is 7.2 cm. Hence, we can calculate the actual height of the tree as follows: Length of AC = 7.2 cm. Since 1 cm in the scale diagram represents 100 cm, From a sixty meter tall lighthouse a boat A is observed at sea with an angle of depression of 31x and another boat B with an angle of depression of 45x (see the figure). The two boats and the lighthouse are in the same vertical plane. Draw a scale diagram depicting the above information and find the distance between the boats A and B.                                                                                                                                               First let us draw a sketch diagram using the given information. Next let us choose a suitable scale. Let us represent 10 m by 1 cm. Since 1 m = 100 cm, In the chosen scale, 1 cm represents 1000 cm.  the scale is 1: 1000. According to the scale, a 6 cm line must be drawn to represent the lighthouse’s height. Denote this line by CD. • First draw a vertical line segment of length 6 cm and label it CD. • Draw two lines perpendicular to CD at C and D. • Draw an angle of depression of 31x at D. Extend this line to the point where it  = 4000 cm  = 40 m'                                             In a horizontal playground, Dilini is standing at the location A, 5 m away from a netball goal post. She can see the top of the goal post T, with an angle of elevation of 18x from her eye level E. She can see the base of the goal post F, from the same position with an angle of depression of 15x. Draw a scale diagram and find Dilini’s height and the height of the goal post. When a diagram is not given, it is best to draw a sketch diagram prior to drawing the scale diagram. Now, we have to choose a suitable scale for the scale diagram. Let us take 2 cm to represents 1 m. Then, 2 cm represent 100 cm.  1 cm represents 50 cm.  the scale is 1: 50. If 1 m is represented by 2 cm, 5 m is represented by 10 cm. Note: Because the distance between the human and the pole is not large, we get a more accurate answer by taking the man’s height into consideration when drawing the scale diagram. Now let us draw the scale diagram. • Because the distance between A and F is 5 m, draw a line segment of length 10 cm 18x 15x • Because the point E is not yet determined, we cannot draw the angle of elevation or depression at E at once. Instead, we first find E as follows. Observe that Now draw an angle AFE perpendicular to AF at A. • Now that we know point E, draw a line at E perpendicular AE. • Draw the angle of elevation of 18x with the line drawn in the previous step. Label the point T which is the intersection point of the line of sight of this angle of elevation and the line drawn perpendicular to AF at F, as shown in the figure. According to the scale diagram,  AE = 2.6 cm  Dilini’s height = 2.6 « 50 cm      
Also, from the scale diagram,  TF = 6 cm  the height of the goal post = 6 « 50 cm  = 300 cm  = 3 m'               Exercise 32.3 1. Draw scale diagrams according to the given information and find the length AB. 25x 30x 25x 25x 2. A person observes a rocket from a point 400 m horizontally away from the launching pad when the rocket has travelled 700 m vertically up from the launching pad. Using a scale diagram, find the angle of elevation of the rocket. 3. A ladder leaning against a wall is shown in the figure. Draw a scale diagram using the given information and find  (i) the length of the ladder and  (ii) the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall. 4. A ramp for the use of wheelchairs to access a building is shown in the figure. Draw a suitable diagram using the given information and find the length of the ramp. 5. The mathematics teacher Mr. Weerasekera asked Chanuka to find the height of an inaccessible mango tree. Chanuka finds, using his clinometer, that the angle of elevation of the highest point P of the tree from a point A on the horizontal ground is 30x and that the angle of elevation of the same point P from a point B which is 10 m closer to the tree than A is 40x. The points A, B and the mango tree are in the same vertical plane. Find, the height of the mango tree by drawing a suitable scale diagram. (Ignore Chanuka’s height). 400 m                                                       6. Mr. Pieris observes that the angle of elevation to the top of a coconut tree from the upper floor balcony of his house is 40x. The distance from his house to the coconut tree is 6 m. Find the minimum length of a picking pole he could pluck coconuts with from the upper floor balcony. 7. The prefect Sithira was assigned the task of making arrangements for hoisting the national flag at the Independence Day celebration. Sithira needed to find the height of the flag pole. Form the upper floor of a building 10 m from the flagpole, using his clinometer, he observed the top of the flagpole with an angle of elevation of 20x and the bottom of the flagpole with an angle of depression of 50x. Draw a scale diagram using this information and find the height of the flag pole to the nearest metre. 8. The top, P, of a clock tower situated on a horizontal ground has an angle of elevation of 60x from a point A at the brink of a building. The angle of elevation of P from a point B in the building which is 5m directly above the point A, is 45x (see figure on the right). Using a suitable scale diagram, find the height of the clock tower and the distance from A to the foot Q of the clock tower. 9. An observer who stands on a horizontal ground 3m away from a bell tower, observes the top of a bell tower with an angle of elevation of 60x and the bottom of the clock tower with an angle of depression of 25x. Using a suitable scale diagram, find the height of the clock tower and the height of the observer.
