Thilini Sewwandi - Educational Publications Department - Educational Publications Department                     This textbook has been compiled in accordance with the new syllabus to be implemented from 2015. Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to read and understand it on your own. e have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official Languages. Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the begin- ning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them for the subject content of grade 11. In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need to recall previuos knoweledge. You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and doing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them in the classroom. We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience. It is believed that the concept of numbers originated among the human race about 30 000 years ago. This concept which originated and developed independently in various civilizations, evolved globally and has now become a universal field of study named mathematics. It can be assumed that numbers were initially used in early civilizations for simple purposes such as counting and accounting. There is no doubt that the first numerical concepts that were developed were “one” and “two”. Later the concepts of three, four etc., must have been developed. Then man would have realized that he could name any amount that he wished in this manner. Different civilizations used different symbols to name numbers. It is accepted based on historical evidence, that the numerals 1, 2, 3 etc., which we now use, originated in India. The honour of being the first to use the concept of zero as a number as well as being the first to introduce the positional decimal number system also goes to India. This number system is now defined as the Hindu-Arabic number system and the modern belief is that it was first taken to the Middle-East and then to Europe by traders. This system is the standard number system which is accepted and used worldwide now. The manipulation of numbers using the basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) can be considered as a great revolution in the history of mankind in relation to the use of numbers. In this age of technology it is unimaginable to think of the existence of man without numbers and the operations performed on them. Although the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc., can be considered as the first numbers that were used to fulfill certain needs of man, later the number zero, fractional numbers and negative numbers were also included in the number system. During the period when mathematics was developing as a separate field, the attention of mathematicians was directed towards various other types of numbers (sets) too. In this lesson we hope to study about such sets of numbers, their notations and properties. By studying this lesson will be able to  ² to investigate number sets  ² workout basic mathematical operations regarding surds. It is natural that we identify initially the numbers 1, 2, 3, … which we first learnt about as children. These numbers are defined as counting numbers and the set which consists of all these numbers is written using set notation as follows. The reason for this set of numbers to be called the counting numbers is very clear. However its mathematical usage in modern times is limited. The name used most often now for this set is “the set of positive integers”. This set is denoted by The numbers defined as negative integers are – 1, – 2, – 3, etc. Although there is no commonly used symbol to denote this set, some mathematicians, based on the needs of their field of study, use the symbol The positive integers, zero and the negative integers together form the set of . Accordingly, integers. This set is denoted by Let us consider again the set of numbers 1, 2, 3,... This set is also defined as the set ' of natural numbers and is denoted by  Note: There is no consensus among mathematicians regarding which numbers should be considered as natural numbers. The suitability of calling the numbers 1, 2,3, … natural numbers is clear. However some of the mathematicians (especially specialists in set theory), have considered 0 as a natural number in their books.        One reason may be because at that time there was no accepted name nor accepted symbol for the set consisting of 0 and the positive integers.However most books on number theory consider the set of natural numbers to be the set {1, 2, 3,...}.Almost all authors of mathematics books now mention at the beginning of their books which set of numbers they consider as the natural numbers. We have come across earlier that, like the integers, fractions too can be considered as numbers, and that operations such as addition and multiplication can be performed on them too. Every integer can be written as a fraction. (For example, we can write 2 = ). Further, a fraction can be written in different forms, all having the same numerical value. (For example, 1  = ). We have also come across 2 , etc.&' Although we usually think that the numerator negative fractions ^– and denominator of a fraction should consist of integers, this is actually not the case. For example, 3  is also a fraction. However, fractions with integers in both 2 the numerator and the denominator (apart from 0 in the denominator), have an important place in mathematics. They are called rational numbers. The set of rational numbers is denoted by  . Accordingly, the set of rational numbers can be defined using the set builder notation as follows. , – 11 3 There are other ways too of defining the set of rational numbers. One other way is as follows. Both these definitions are equivalent. Since the denominator of a rational number cannot be 0 and since all the negative rational numbers can be obtained by considering the fractions with the negative integers in the numerator and positive integers in the denominator.  It is appropriate to define the irrational numbers now. Do you recall how you learnt about numbers in previous grades by drawing a number line? Let us reconsider this now. Let us consider a straight line which can be lengthened as required in either direction. Let us name a point we like on that line as the origin 0. Let us assume that we have marked all the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., on one side of 0 (usually the right hand side) and all the numbers – 1, – 2, – 3 etc., on the opposite side, keeping equal gaps between the numbers. That is, let us assume that the points corresponding to all the integers have been marked on this number line. Let us also assume that the points corresponding to all the rational numbers too have been marked on this line. Accordingly, all the rational numbers (including the integers) are now assumed to have been marked on this line. Now, do you think that corresponding to each point on the line, a number has been marked? If asked differently, do you think that the distance from 0 to each point on the line can be written as a rational number? In truth, there are several points remaining on the number line which have not been marked. That is, there are points remaining on this number line that cannot be represented by a rational number. It is clear that the points that are remaining are those which correspond to the numbers which cannot be written in the form  a , where a and b are integers. The numbers which correspond to the remaining b points are defined as irrational numbers. – 7 5 There is no specific symbol to denote the set of irrational numbers and it is usually . The numbers 2" 3" 5 can be denoted by given as examples of irrational numbers. In fact, the square root of any positive integer which is not a perfect square is an irrational number. Apart from these, mathematicians have proved that π, which is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter, is also an irrational number. We take the value of π to be 22 7 as an approximate value, for the convenience of performing calculations.  According to the above discussion, all the numbers on a number line can be represented by rational numbers or irrational numbers. We call all the rational numbers together with all the irrational numbers, that is, all the numbers that can be represented on a number line, the real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted by Any real number can be represented as a decimal number. Initially, let us consider the decimal representation of several rational numbers. A common property of these decimal representations is that starting at a certain point to the right of the decimal point (or from the beginning), one set of numerals (or one numeral) is recurring. Recurring means that it keeps repeating itself. or example, in the decimal representation of 1 , the numeral 0 recurs starting from 2 the second decimal place. The numeral 0 recurs from the first decimal place in the  1 2 = 0.5 = 0.5000 ...  11 8  211 99  767 150  37 7 decimal representation of 4, the pair of numerals 13 recurs from the beginning in the decimal representation of 211 99  37 7 . This property, that is, a group the beginning in the decimal representation of of numerals recurring continuously, is a property common to all rational numbers. If the portion that recurs is just 0, such a decimal representation is defined as a finite decimal (or terminating decimal). The decimals of which the portion that      " 4 and 11 8 recurs is not zero, are called recurring decimals. Accordingly, above example are finite decimals while the rest are recurring decimals. Every rational number can be written as a finite decimal or a recurring decimal. Let us now learn a marvelous result regarding rational numbers. Suppose the rational number a b b have no common factors. Then the denominator (that is, b) has only powers of 2 or 5 (or both) as its factors. A rational number which has a recurring decimal representation must have a prime factor other than 2 and 5 in its denominator. Recurring decimals are written in a concise form, by placing a dot above a numeral or numerals as shown in the following examples to indicate that they are recurring. . 12.4 . . 2.13 . 5.113 . . 5.285714 Exercise 1.1 1. For each of the following rational numbers state whether it is a finite decimal or a recurring decimal. Express the fractions which are recurring decimals in decimal form and then write them in a concise form. 19 33 13 50 i.  7 64  5 18 k. 15 128  l. 41 360        2. The decimal representation of an irrational number Finally, let us consider the decimal representation of an irrational number. In the decimal representation of an irrational number, no group of numerals recurs. For example, when the decimal representation of 2 is written down up to 60 decimal places, we obtain the following: π, which is a number we come across often is also an irrational number. When the value of π is calculated up to 60 decimal places we obtain the following: There is no group of recurring numerals in the decimal representation of an irrational number. If the decimal representation of a number is not finite, it is called an infinite decimal. Accordingly rational numbers which are recurring decimals and irrational numbers have infinite decimal representations. Note: When describing the decimal representation of irrational numbers, one frequent error that is made is stating that “there is no pattern in the decimal representation of an irrational number”. The issue here is that the word “pattern” is not well defined in mathematics. For example, the following decimal number has a very clear pattern. However, this is an irrational number, Observe that there is no group of recurring numbers. All the sets of numbers that have been studied so far can be represented in a Venn diagram as follows, with the set of real numbers as the universal set, and the other sets as its subsets. A few numbers belonging to each subset have been included to make it easier for you to understand the relationship between the sets. a. Any real number is a finite decimal or an infinite decimal. b. There can be rational numbers with infinite decimals representations. c. Any real number is a recurring decimal or an infinite decimal. d. 0.010110111011110... is a rational number.    2  √  2  √  √ 3  3  √   
π π 13 5 13 5 21 3 21 −2 −2    + N(=Z +      There is no doubt that you recall how numerical (and algebraic) expressions are  ˜ which is defined as the radical sign. For example, written using the symbol 4 is defined as the positive square root of 4 and it represents the positive number which when squared is equal to 4; that is 2. The positive square root is referred to as square root too. If a certain positive integer x is such that its square root x is also a positive integer, then x is defined as a perfect square. Accordingly, 4 is a perfect square. Since 4 is equal to 2. However, 2 is not the square root of a perfect square. We observed earlier that 2 is approximately equal to 1.414. We also learnt earlier in this lesson that 2 is an irrational number. A numerical term  of which the value is not a rational number is defined as involving the symbol a surd.  ˜ is used not only to denote the square roots of numbers, The radical sign — but also other roots. For example, 23  denotes the positive number which when raised to the power 3 is equal to 2. This is called the cube root of 2. This is also an irrational number. Its value is approximately 1.2599. (You can verify this by finding the value of 1.25993). We can define the fourth root of 2 and the fifth root of 2 etc., in a similar manner. Such definitions can be made for other positive numbers as well; for example, 53 . Such expressions are also surds. However, in this lesson we will only consider surds which are square roots of positive integers. 6  and 8.24  
The square root of a positive integer which is not a perfect square is neither a finite decimal nor a recurring decimal. Observe that surds are therefore always irrational numbers. Here our focus is on simplifying expressions which involve surds. There are many reasons why such simplifications are important. One reason is that it facilitates , if we calculations. For example, when it is necessary to find the value of take 2 to be approximately equal to 1.414, we would need to find the value of . This division is fairly long. However, by simplifying this in the following 1 1.414 manner, calculations are made easier. 1.414 2    For example, let us find the value of 20 2 value for 20 , and 2.2 as an approximate value for 5 . Then 20 2 = = 4.5 2 2.25 – 2.2 However, the actual value of this expression is 0. One reason for getting a different answer is because we used approximate values for 20 and 5 . However, by simplifying the above expression in a different way, we can get the correct value which is 0. Surds appear in various form. A special feature of a surd of the form 20 is that the whole number is under the radical sign. Such surds are defined as entire surds. 6 15 means 6 × 15. This is a product of a surd and a rational number (not equal to 1). This is not an entire surd. A surd is in its simplest form when it is in the form a b ; where a is a rational number and b has no factors which are perfect squares. For example 6 15 is in its simplest form but 5 12 is not, since 4 which is a perfect square is a factor of 12.  3 5 + 6 5 = 9 5 . This simplification is similar to the simplification 3x + 6x = 9x. Observe that the expression obtained above in surd form cannot be simplified further. Keep in mind that simplifying further by using an approximate value for You should also keep in mind the important fact that an expression of the form 3 2 + 8 3 cannot be simplified further. Now let us through examples, consider how expressions with surds are simplified by applying the properties of indices.        ( Since 4 = = 16 80 Example 4 Simplify: 5 3 4 2 . = 20 3 2 = 20 6 The surd 3 20 can be written as 3 4 5 . Simplifying further, it can be written as 3 2 5 = 6 5 ... 3 20 ..2 5 = 3 2 6 2               for such expressions are in the denominator. Now let us consider how such an expression can be converted into an expression with an integer (or a rational number) in the denominator. 2 2  by 2 3 2 Example 6 Express a Rationalise the denominator of b a b a b a  = – 9 7  = – 9 Example 8 Example 8 Simplify 4 63 – 5 7 – 8 28 .

Convert the following surds into entire surds. 2    25 3 5              27 2 12 3 4 2 110 11 20 2          Do the following exercise to revise what you have learned so far about indices and logarithms.

Third power of 2 is 8' Thus, the cube root of 8 is 2. This can be denoted symbolically as"  2 2 2 = 21 21 21  = 23  = 8  Therefore it is clear that 8√ Futhermore, if a is a positive real number, then   ,  and '  a√ = a  3 a√  = a  4 a√  = a 4.

Therefore, from x5 = 25 we can conclude that x = 2' If x2 = 32 then the indices are equal but in this case, both + 3 and − 3 are solutions. The reason for two solutions arising is because the exponent — 2 ˜ is an even number. In this lesson, we will only consider powers with i. 1 64 – (0.125) 4 √ 81 10000 – 1 (81) 1 o.

Given below are a few examples, where this law is applied to powers with fractional indices.

Do the following exercise to refresh the memory on using logarithms to simplify expressions involving multiplications and divisions of numbers.   8.7 12.5  9.87 7.85 4.321 Scientific notation  a. lg 5.745 =  b. lg 9.005 = c. lg 82.8 =  d. lg 74.01 = = e. lg 853.1 f. antilog 0.7453 =  g. antilog 0.0014 =  h. antilog 1.9251 = i. antilog 2.4374 = j. antilog 3.2001 =      0.7593, therefore ..........., therefore ..........., therefore ..........., therefore ..........., therefore 5.562, therefore ..........., therefore ..........., therefore ..........., therefore ..........., therefore 5.745 = 100.7593 9.005 = 10 ........ 82.8 = 10 ........ 74.01 = 10 ........ 853.1 = 10 ........ 5.562 = 100.7453 ......... = 100.0014 ........ = 101.9251 ......... = 102.4374 ......... = 103.2001 27.32 9.8 11.5 ......... ∴ P = antilog .......... = ............   27.32 9.8 11.5 10..... 10...... 10...... = 10..... 10...... = 10......  = ........ 10....... = ............          Let us now consider how to use the table of logarithms to obtain the logarithms of numbers between 0 and 1, by paying close attention to how we obtained the logarithms of numbers greater than 1. For this purpose, carefully investigate the following table.  5432  543.2  54.32  5.432  0.5432  0.05432  0.005432  0.0005432 5.432 103 5.432 102 5.432 101 5.432 100 5.432 10− 1 5.432 10− 2 5.432 10− 3 5.432 10− 4  3  2  1  0 0.7350 0.7350 0.7350 0.7350 3.7350 2.7350 1.7350 0.7350  1 −.7350  2 −.7350  3 −.7350  4 −.7350 According to the above table, the characteristic of the logarithm of numbers inbetween 0 and 1, coming after 5.432 in the first column, are negative' Even though the characteristic is negative, the mantissa of the logarithm, which is found using the table, is a positive number. The symbol —−˜ is used above the whole part to indicate that only the characteristic is negative. It is read as "bar". For example, 2 −.3725 is read as "bar two point three, seven, two, five"' Moreover, what is represented by 2 −.3725 is − 2 + 0.3725' The characteristic of the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. The characteristic of the logarithm of such a number can be obtained either by writing it in scientific notation or by counting the number of zeros after the decimal point. The characteristic of the logarithm can be obtained by adding one to the number of zeros after the decimal point (and before the next non-zero digit) and taking its negative value. Observe it in the above table too. 0.004302 Number of zeros after the decimal point and before the next non-zero digit is 2. Therefore characteristic of the logarithm is 3−   characteristic of the logarithm is 2− Number of zeros after the decimal point is 0; thus the characteristic of the logarithm is 1−    herefore, lg 0.004302 = 3− .6337' When written using indices, it is; 0.004302 = 103− .6337' This can also be written as" 0.004302 = 10 −3 100.6337' Do the following exercise to practice taking logarithms of numbers between 0 and 1. a. 0.831  d. 0.009 b. 0.01175 e. 0.00005 c. 0.0034 f. 0.00098 When a number is written in scientific form, the index of the power of 10 is the characteristic of the logarithm of that number. The characteristic of the logarithm indicates the number of places that the decimal point needs to be shifted when taking the antilog. Thus, we obtained 552.2 by shifting the decimal point of 5.522 two places to the right. However, when the characteristic is negative the decimal point is shifted to the left side. 30 a. 0.9843  d. 0.0019 b. 0.05 e. 0.003141 c. 0.0725 f. 0.000783 2.

But we now know that, the characteristic can be positive, negative or zero. In 2−. 5143, the mantissa, .5143, is positive and the characteristic, 2−, is negative' When adding or subtracting such numbers, it is important to simplify the characteristic and the mantissa separately.

Carefully observe the solid objects in the above figure. Note that their faces are polygons. Of these faces, the horizontal face at the bottom is called the base. All the faces, except the base are of triangular shape. The common point of these triangular faces is called the "apex". A solid object with these properties is called a "pyramid". Note that the bases of the Pyramids shown above are respectively, the shape of a quadrilateral, a pentagon and a hexagon. Slant edge Perpendicular height The base of the pyramid in the figure is a square. All the remaining faces are triangular in shape. If the line segment connecting the apex and the midpoint of the square base (that is the intersection point of the two diagonals) is perpendicular to the base, then such a pyramid is called a "square based right pyramid". The length of the line segment connecting the apex and the midpoint of the base is called the perpendicular height (or simply the height) of the pyramid. The edges of the triangular faces which are not common to the base are called slant edges. In this lesson, we will only consider finding the surface area of square based right pyramids. 50 ² find the surface area of a right pyramid with a square base, ² find the surface area of a right circular cone, and ² find the surface area of a sphere.    Note: A tetrahedron can also be considered as a pyramid. All the faces of a tetrahedron are triangular in shape. Any one of the faces can be taken as the base. The concept of —right pyramid˜ can be defined even when the base is not a square. For example, we can define a right pyramid when the base of a pyramid is a regular polygon, as follows. First note that all the axes of symmetry of a regular polygon pass through a common point, which is called the centroid of the regular polygon. A pyramid, having a base which is a regular polygon, is called a right pyramid, if the line segment connecting the apex and the centroid of the base is perpendicular to the base. If you study mathematics further, you will learn how to define the centroid, even when the base is not a regular polygon. An important property of a square based right pyramid is that all its triangular faces are congruent to each other. Therefore, all the triangular faces have the same area. Moreover, note that each triangular face is an isosceles or an equilateral triangle, with one side a side of the square base and the other two sides equal in length. To find the total surface area of a square based right pyramid we need to add the areas of the base and the four triangular faces. Suppose the length of a side of the square base is —a˜ and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is "l". Perpendicular height (h) Perpendicular height of the triangular face (l) (There are 4 such faces) Area of the square base Area of a triangular face a a + 4 a2 + 2al Total surface area of the square based right pyramid = If the total surface area is A, Let us now consider some solved examples on the surface area of a square based right pyramid. The base length of a square based right pyramid is 10 cm and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is 15 cm. Find the total surface area of the pyramid. = 10 10 = 100 = 1 2 = 75 Shown in the figure is a square based right pyramid of perpendicular height 8 cm and base length 12 cm. Find  (i) the perpendicular height of a triangular face,  (ii) the area of a triangular face, and  (iii) the total surface area of the pyramid. Let us take the perpendicular height of a triangular face to be l cm. Consider the shaded triangle in the above figure.          (i) l2 = 82 + 62 = 64 + 36 = 100    = 144 + 240  = 384 1.

In a square based right pyramid, the length of a side of the square base is 8 cm and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is 20 cm. What is the surface area of the pyramid?

The area of the fabric that is used to make a tent in the shape of a square based right pyramid, is 80 m2. Find the height of the tent, if the fabric is not used for the base of the tent and the length of a side of the base is 8cm. 9. The height of a tent in the shape of a square based right pyramid is 4m and the perpendicular height of a triangular face is 5 m. If both the roof and the base of the tent is to be made from fabric, how much material is required? 0.It is required to construct a tent in the shape of a square based pyramid of base length 16 m and height 6 m. Find the fabric needed to construct the tent, also covering the base.                                                                                 Shown above are some conical (cone shaped) objects. A cone has a circular plane surface and a curved surface. The circular plane surface is called the base of the cone. The point through which all the straight lines drawn on the curved surface pass through is called the "apex" of the cone. Curved surface perpendicular  height A cone is called a right circular cone if the line segment connecting the apex and the centre of is perpendicular to the circular base of a right circle cone. The radius of the base circle is called the radius of the cone. The length of the line segment connecting the centre of the base and the apex is the perpendicular height of a right circular cone. Moreover, any line segment connecting the apex and a point on the perimeter of the base circle is called a generator of the cone. The length of a generator is called the "slant height " of the cone. It is customary to use —r˜ for the radius, —h˜ for the height and —l˜ for the slant height of a cone. To explain a method to find the surface area of a right circular cone, consider a hollow right circular cone made from a thin sheet. Observe that the base of such a cone is a circular plane surface. Cutting open the curved surface along a generator, gives a lamina, the shape of a circular sector. Given the radius and the slant height of a right circular cone, one can find surface area of the cone, by finding the area of the circular base and the area of the curved surface. We can use the formula πr2 to find the area of the circular base. We can find the area of the circular sector as follows.   The area of the sector with the above angle θ (as learnt in grade 10) is θ 360 360r l πl 2 360 area of the curved surface of the cone area of the circular base Total surface area of the cone Let us now consider some solved examples on the surface area of a cone. In this lesson let us take the value of π as 22  7 Shown in the figure is a solid right circular cone. Its radius is 7 cm and slant height is 12 cm. Find the total surface area of the cone. The surface area of the curved surface is equal to the area of the sector that is obtained by cutting it open. Because the arc length of the sector is the circumference of the base circle, the arc length of the sector is equal to 2πr. Also note that the radius of this sector is the slant height —l˜. Now, as you have learned in the lesson on the perimeter of a circular sector in Grade 10, if the angle of the sector is θ then θ 360 360r l       = πrl 22  7 = 264

There is no doubt that you know what properties a sphere has. In mathematics, a sphere is defined as the set of points in three dimensional space that lies at a constant distance from a fixed point. The fixed point is called the centre of the sphere and the constant distance from the centre to a point on the sphere is called the radius of the sphere. A sphere has only one curved surface, and has no edges or vertices. curved surface is 396 cm2 , find  (i) the radius of the cone, and  (ii) the perpendicular height of the cone. Shown in the picture, is a thin glass container in the shape of a cone filled with a juice to half its height. The radius of the glass is 12 cm and its height is 16 cm. Find the area of the region on the glass surface that is in contact with the juice.               A cylinder with the same radius as the sphere and height equal to the diameter of the sphere is called the circumscribing cylinder of the sphere. The sphere will tightly fit in the circumscribing cylinder of the sphere. The following fact regarding the surface area of a sphere and its circumscribing cylinder was observed by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, who lived around 225 B.C.  D S  C When the sphere is inside the circumscribing cylinder, any two planes parallel to the flat circular surfaces of the cylinder will bound equal surface areas on the curved surfaces of the sphere and cylinder. A B For example, in the above figure, the area of the curved surface PQRS on the sphere is the same as the area of the curved surface ABCD on the cylinder. Now, if we apply this fact to the entire cylinder, we see that the surface area of the sphere is equal to the surface area of the curved surface of the cylinder. We can use the formulae 2πrh to find the surface area of the curved surface of the circumscribing cylinder.  = 4πr2  Therefore, the surface area of the sphere = 4πr2      Surface area of the sphere = 4πr2  22  7

Review Exercise 1. Shown below are figures of some solid objects that you have studied before.        By studying this lesson you will be able to  • compute the volume of a square based right pyramid, right circular cone and a Let us do the following activity to construct a formula to find the volume of a square based right pyramid. Use a piece of cardboard to construct the hollow cuboid and the hollow pyramid, shown in the following figure. The cuboid has a square base with 6 cm sides and is of height 10 cm. It does not have a top. The right pyramid has a square base, again with 6 cm sides, and the height of the pyramid is also 10 cm. Do not include a base, so that you can fill it with sand. You would have observed in the above activity, that filling the pyramid completely with sand and emptying it into the cuboid thrice, will completely fill the cuboid without any overflow. Let us consider a square based cuboid with side length a and height h, and a square based right pyramid of side length a and height h. Completely fill the pyramid with sand and empty it into the cuboid. Find how many times you need to do this to fill the cuboid.

Archimedes, the Greek mathematician who explained the surface area of a sphere in terms of the circumscribing cylinder, also explained the volume of a sphere in terms of the volume of the circumscribing cylinder. Let us do the following activity to understand his finding.  Find a small sphere of radius 3 cm.

Cover top with a piece of cardboad and flip it over and fill the remaining part that is not occupied by the sphere also with sand. Put the total amount of sand that you used to fill the remaining volume of the cylinder after inserting the sphere into the cone that you made earlier. Note that the volume of sand fills the cone completely. Therefore, we can find the volume of the sphere by subtracting the volume of the cone from the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.

It is illustrated in the following example'  = x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y + 2xy2 + y3  = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3 Accordingly, let us remember the following pattern as a formula for the expansion of the cube of the binomial expression (x + y). cube of the second term three times the product of the square of the first term and the second term. three times the product of the first term and the square of the second term                 Similarly, we can write (a + 2)3 = a3 + 3a2 × 2 + 3a × 22 + 23, and this can be further simplified as " a3 + 6a2 + 12a + 8 Now let us consider how the expansion of (x – y)3 is obtained by taking products. = x3 – 2x2y + xy2 – x2y +2xy2 – y3 = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3 Now, let us consider how we can obtain the expansion of (x – y)3, using another method. First, note that we can write x – y as x + (– y)' Therefore, we can treat (x – y)3 as an expression of the initial form, by writing it as {x + (– y)}3' Let us now consider the expansion of this cube. (x – y)3 = {x + (– y)}3 = x3 + 3 × x2 × (– y) + 3 × x × (– y)2 + (– y)3  = x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3  Note that we have used the properties (– y)2 = y 2 and (– y)3 = – y 3 in the above simplification. (m – n)3 = m3 – 3m2n + 3mn2 – n3 (p – q)3 = p3 – 3p2q + 3pq2 – q3 method which is easy for you. Let us now consider how the cube of a binomial expression, involving numbers as well, is expanded.

These simplifications can be done either before multiplying the fractions or after multiplying the fractions. Let us now consider multiplying two fractions where such simplifications are possible. 80 Do the following exercise to revise what you have learned before on adding and subtracting algebraic fractions. Two algebraic fractions can be multiplied in the same way that two numerical fractions are multiplied. Let us consider the following example. What we mean by performing the multiplication is to express this product as a single fraction.  x 3 To perform this multiplication, we multiply the numerators and denominators of the two fractions separately, and obtain a single fraction. That is, x x × 2 3 x x× 2 × 3  x2 6 7 3m  3 4m  8– m a + 3 a2 – 4  1 + a + 2 1 m + 2  2 m + 3  3– x 9 x + 2  1 x 2a 5 2 x2 – x – 2  1 x2 – 1 1 x2 – 9x + 20  1 x2 – 11x + 30 By studying this lesson, you will understand  how algebraic fractions are multiplied and divided. Here, we can cancel the common factor 2, of the numerator 8 of the first fraction and the denominator 2b of the second fraction. We perform this simplification as follows.  3 2b × 1  3 2b Now, by multiplying the expressions in the numerators and denominators of the two fractions separately, we get a single fraction as given below.  3 2b 4 3× a × b 12 ab  3 2b We can also cancel the common factors after multiplying the fractions. Consider the following example. However, by cancelling the common factors before doing this the multiplication, you can minimise long multiplications and divisions. Therefore, doing this is encouraged. 3 2a 2b 3 6b= 6a  4 5x  4 5x 1 4× y × 5 4 5y When multiplying fractions with algebraic expressions in the numerator and the denominator, first factorise the expressions.

You multiplied the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Similarly, when dividing an algebraic fraction by another algebraic fraction, we can instead multiply the first by the reciprocal of the second. Before we study how algebraic fractions are divided, let us consider the reciprocal of an algebraic fraction. Recall the facts we have leaned regarding the reciprocal of a number. If the product of two numbers is 1, then each number is the reciprocal or the multiplicative inverse of the other number. The reciprocal of an algebraic fraction is also described similarly. That is, if the product of two algebraic fractions is 1, then each algebraic fraction is the reciprocal of the other. 5 ×x x 5 1 1 x + 1 y y x + 1 y x + 1 y x + 1 x + 1 . y    a b  a 4 ×  ab  4 ab 4  b 2  a b ab ÷  4  a b ab ÷  4 by simply interchanging the numerator and denominator, as you have done with numerical fractions.

Let us now recall how the areas of triangles and parallelograms are found. When finding the areas of triangles and parallelograms, the terms altitude and base are used. Let us first recall what these terms mean. When finding the area of a triangle, any one of its sides can be considered as the base. For example, the side BC of the triangle ABC can be considered as the base. Then AD is the corresponding altitude; that is, the perpendicular dropped from the vertex A to the side BC. Similarly, if we consider the side AB to be the base, the corresponding altitude is CE. Accordingly, we can also write, We know that, area of triangle ABC = We can similarly find the area of the triangle ABC by taking AC as the base and drawing the corresponding altitude from the vertex B.  identify the theorems on the relationships between the areas of triangles and parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines, and solve problems related to them.      Now let us consider the parallelogram PQRS. Here too, the area can be found by considering any one of the sides as the base. If we consider the side QR as the base, the corresponding altitude is the line segment PM. The length of PM is the distance between the two parallel straight line segments QR and PS, the side opposite QR. Similarly, if we consider the side PQ as the base, the corresponding altitude is RN. Therefore we can also write, Note The length of the altitude of a triangle or a parallelogram is also often called the altitude. To recall what has been learnt earlier regarding finding the areas of parallelograms and triangles, do the following exercise by applying the above facts.    Let us first see what is meant by parallelograms and triangles on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Consider the following figures.  Both the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF in figure (i) lie between the pair of straight lines AB and DE. What is meant here by the word “between” is that a pair  Both the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF in figure (i) lie between the pair of of opposite sides of each of the parallelograms lies on the straight lines AB and straight lines AB and DE. What is meant here by the word “between” is that a pair DE. Further, the side AB is common to both parallelograms. In such a situation, of opposite sides of each of the parallelograms lies on the straight lines AB and we say that the two parallelograms are on the same base and between the same DE. Further, the side AB is common to both parallelograms. In such a situation, pair of parallel lines. Here, the common side AB has been considered as the base. we say that the two parallelograms are on the same base and between the same It is clear that corresponding to this common base, both the parallelograms have pair of parallel lines. Here, the common side AB has been considered as the base. the same altitude. This is equal to the perpendicular distance between the two It is clear that corresponding to this common base, both the parallelograms have parallel lines AB and DE. the same altitude. This is equal to the perpendicular distance between the two parallel lines AB and DE.  Figure (ii) depicts a parallelogram and a triangle which lie on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC. The parallelogram is ABCD  Figure (ii) depicts a parallelogram and a triangle which lie on the same base and and the triangle is ABE. The common base is AB. Observe that in this case, one between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC. The parallelogram is ABCD side of the triangle lies on one of the parallel lines while the opposite vertex lies and the triangle is ABE. The common base is AB. Observe that in this case, one on the other line. side of the triangle and the opposite vertex lies on each parallel straight lines.  Figure (iii) depicts two triangles on the same base and between the same pair of  Figure (iii) depicts two triangles on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines.

Write down all the triangles with the same base OP lie between the pair of parallel straight lines AQ and CP in the given figure. the perpendicular distance between the pair of parallel straight lines AB and CD is denoted by h and the base lengths of the parallelograms by a and b. Write down the areas of the parallelograms PQRS, KLSR and MNUT in terms of these symbols. the parallelogram PQMN in the given figure lie between the pair of parallel straight lines AB and CD. NM = 10 cm and LM = 8 cm.                         Next we look at the relationship between the areas of parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Consider the given parallelograms. Observe that, area of parallelogram ABCD = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle AFD area of parallelogram ABEF = area of trapezium ABCF + area of triangle BEC Therefore it is clear that, if the area of triangle AFD = the area of triangle BEC, then the areas of the two parallelograms will be equal. In fact, these two triangles are congruent. Therefore their areas are equal. The congruence of the two triangles under the conditions of SAS can be shown as follows. AD = BC (opposite sides of a parallelogram) AF = BE (opposite sides of a parallelogram) Also, since DAB angles), by subtracting these equations we obtain Therefore we obtain, area of parallelogram ABCD = area of parallelogram ABEF.  DAF Accordingly, the two triangles AFD and BEC are congruent under the conditions of SAS.      Now let us obtain an important result using this theorem. You have used the following formula when finding the area of a parallelogram in previous grades and in the above exercise. Have you ever thought about how this result was obtained? We can now use the above theorem to prove this result. The figure depicts a rectangle ABCD (that is, a parallelogram) and a parallelogram ABEF on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. According to the above theorem, their areas are equal. We know that, area of the parallelogram ABEF = Area of the rectangle ABCD = AB AD = AB perpendicular distance between the  two parallel lines = base of the parallelogram perpendicular height             (ii) What is the area of the parallelogram ABCD?  (iii) Find the perpendicular distance between the parallel lines AB and FC. Now let us answer these questions.  (i) ABEF and ABCD.  (ii) Since the parallelograms ABEF and ABCD lie on the same base AB and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and FC, their areas are equal. Therefore, the area of ABCD = 80 cm2.  80 = 8 h  ... h = 10  (i) show that ABQD and ABCP are parallelograms. (ii) show that the parallelograms ABQD and ABCP are of the same area. ^iii& prove that ^iv& prove that, area of parallelogram AXQR = area of parallelogram BXPS. ^i& In the quadrilateral ABQD (given)  AB//DQ (given)  AD//BQ Since a quadrilateral with pairs of opposite sides parallel, is a parallelogram, ABQD is a parallelogram. Similarly, since AB // PC and AP // BC, we obtain that ABCP is a parallelogram.              ^ii& Since the parallelograms ABQD and ABCP lie on the same base AB and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and DC, by the above theorem, their areas are equal.  SCP = RQD  Further, AB = PC (opposite sides of the parallelogram ABCP)   Therefore, PC = DQ. ... Therefore, by subtracting the area of the triangle ABX from both sides, we get area of trapezium ABQR  ... area of parallelogram AXQR = area of parallelogram BXPS.  ABSP

Based on the information in the figure, prove that the area of triangle ADP is equal to the area of triangle BRC.  and AD = 5 cm. Construct the rhombus ABEF equal in area to the area of ABCD and lying on the same side of AB as the parallelogram. State the theorem that you used for your construction.        Now let us draw a line parallel to AB through the point C, as shown in the figure, and mark the point D on this line such that ABDC is a parallelogram. In other words let us mark the intersection point of the line drawn through B parallel to AC and the line drawn through C parallel to AB, as D. The area of the triangle ABC is exactly half the area of the parallelogram ABDC. This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. We learnt this in the lesson on parallelograms in Grade 10. Therefore, area of triangle ABC =             In section 8.2 of this lesson, we learnt that the areas of parallelograms on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines are equal. Therefore, in relation to the above figure, the area of any parallelogram that lies on the same base AB and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD is equal to the area of ABDC. Therefore, area of triangle ABC = The figure illustrates a parallelogram PQRS and a triangle STR on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. The area of the parallelogram PQRS is 60 cm2.  (i)The parallelogram PQRS and the triangle STR lie on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines. Therefore the area of triangle STR is half the area of parallelogram PQRS.

Now let us consider the two triangles PQR and TQR that lie on the same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD. U As discussed in section 8.3 the parallelogram related to the triangle PQR is PQRS, and the parallelogram related to the triangle TQR is TQRU. However, since the parallelograms PQRS and TQRU lie on the same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines, by the theorem, area of parallelogram PQRS = area of parallelogram TQRU. ... As stated previously, the areas of the two triangles PQR and TQR which lie on the same base QR and between the same pair of parallel lines AB and CD are equal in area. Triangles which satisfy the above given conditions in this manner are equal in area. This is stated as a theorem as follows.
