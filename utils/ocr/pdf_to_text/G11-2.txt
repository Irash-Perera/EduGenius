Textbooks are compiled for students. Therefore, we have made an attempt to compile this textbook in a simple and detailed manner making it possible for you to read and understand it on your own. e have included descriptions, activities and examples to introduce the subject concepts in an attractive manner and to establish them. Moreover, activities are organized from simple to complex to develop an interest to do them. We have used the terms related to mathematical concepts in accordance with the glossary of technical terms of mathematics compiled by the Department of Official Languages. Some subject matter learnt during the earlier grades is necessary to learn the subject content in the grade 11 syllabus. Thus, review exercises are included at the beginning of each chapter to revise previous knowledge. You will be prepared by them for the subject content of grade 11. In addition, students may use the grade 10 book which you have if you need to recall previuos knoweledge. You will gain maximum benefit from this textbook by reading the chapters and doing the review exercises of each chapter even before your teacher teaches them in the classroom. We hope that studying mathematics will be an interesting, joyful and productive experience. Review Exercise 1. Compute the following percentages. a. 12% of 800 rupees. c. 2.5% of 1200 g.    Our daily household expenses fall into two main categories as capital expenses and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are the expenses we incur on a regular basis and would include our spending on food, clothes, medicine and electricity bills. Capital expenses are one-time expenses that are not repeated on a regular basis. For instance our spending on purchasing a land, a house, a vehicle, machinery or furniture is a capital expense. Such purchases are generally of significant value and may often require a loan from the place of work or from a financial institution. b. 8% of 1 Kilometre. d. 25% of 2.5 Litres. 5. Sunimal takes out a loan of Rs 10 000 that charges a monthly simple interest rate of 2%. What is the total amount that he will re-pay if he wants to settle the entire loan in 3 months? By studying this lesson, you will be able to: • compute the loan instalment when the interest is computed on the reducing Money borrowed as a loan is not paid back in full right away. Rather, it is paid back over a long period of time as monthly partial payments.Usually a loan is expected to be repaid with interest. The part of the loan and the interest that is to be paid every month is referred to as a loan instalment. However, some manufacturers or distributors may sell their merchandise on an interest free installment plan to promote sales. Example 1 A furniture manufacturer sells a Rs 30 000 worth wooden wardrobe on an interest free scheme of 12 monthly payments.What is the amount paid as an instalment? Example 2 A festival advance of Rs 5000 is given to employees of government institutions. This interest free advance has to be paid back in 10 equal monthly instalments. If each installment is deducted from the salary, what is the amount deducted from the salary each month? The amount deducted from the monthly salary each month = Rs 5 000 10 There are several ways of charging interest on a loan. Calculating the loan interest on the reducing balance is a common method. Let us explore this. When you borrow money to repay in monthly instalments, or if you purchase an item with a down payment with the understanding that the rest of the money will be paid in instalments, most of the time you will be expected to pay an interest on the loan. Here, the loan is paid in monthly instalments. The interest calculation is based on the outstanding loan balance. That is the balance money that remains in the borrowers hands as the loan is repaid during the loan term. As the borrower repays instalments, the remaining loan balance reduces over time. Interest is then charged only on the loan amount that the borrower still holds. Therefore this method of calculating the interest is called, computing the interest on the reducing balance.                         Once the total interest to be paid is calculated, the monthly installments are determined, such that every installment is of the same value. Study the following examples to understand the method of calculating the loan interest on the reducing balance and the value of an installment. Example 1 Mr Wickramasinghe has borrowed Rs 30 000 as a business loan from a bank that charges an annual interest rate of 24%. The loan has to be paid back in six equal monthly instalments and the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. Calculate the value of a monthly instalment.  The loan amount = Rs 30 000  Amount due from the principal loan per month without interest = Rs 30 000  In this method, the outstanding loan balance is reduced by Rs 5000 every month and interest is charged only on the loan balance. Annual interest rate  Monthly interest rate = 24% = 2% = Rs 20 000 = Rs 400  2 100  2 100  2 100  2 100  2 100                                              2 100 Calculating the interest as in the above method could be lengthy and time consuming. Therefore we adopt the following easier method to calculate the interest. Interest charged on amount due per month from the principal loan   
 2 100 Therefore, the total interest paid = Rs 100 6 + 100 5 + 100 4 + 100 3 + 100 2 + 100 1  = Rs 100 (6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)  = Rs 100 21  = Rs 2 100 where 21 is the total number of portions of the loan that is to be paid within the six months.We will call this the number of month units. We calculate the number of month units as This can be thought of as a sum of an arithmetic progression and can be found using the formula n 2  6 2 = 3 7 = 21                                                Example 2 A television priced at Rs 25 000 can be purchased by making a down payment of Rs 7 000 and paying the remainder by 12 equal monthly installments. If an annual interest rate of 18% is charged on the loan,where the interest is calculated on the reducing balance, find the value of a monthly installment. Price of the television = Rs 25 000 The down payment = Rs 7 000 ∴ Interest paid for a month unit = Rs 1 500 18 100  1 12  12 2 = 6 13 = 78 Example 3 The following advertisement was displayed in a shop: If the interest on the loan was calculated on the reducing loan balance, calculate the interest rate.  number of instalments 2 A washing machine worth Rs 30 000 is available for a down payment of Rs 5000 and 10 equal monthly instalments of Rs 2720.                    Price of the washing machine = Rs 30 000  The down payment = Rs 5 000   10 2  = 55 2. A government servant can acquire a loan up to ten times of his monthly salary at an annual interest rate of 4.2%. The loan has to be repaid within 5 years in equal monthly instalments. If Nimal draws a salary of Rs 30 000 per month; determine the following.  (i) How much can Nimal acquire as a loan?  (ii) What is the duration of the loan in months? (iii) If the interest is charged on the reducing balance, calculate the total  (i) Find the amount due from the principal loan amount each month.  (ii) Find the interest charged on the principal loan amount each month. (iii) For how many month units should she pay the interest? (iv) Find the total interest she should pay under the reducing loan balance  (v) Find the amount of a monthly installment. (iv) What is the total amount due under the reducing loan balance?  (v) Find the amount of a monthly installment.                        3. A dining table worth Rs 35 000 can be purchased with a Rs 5000 cash down payment and the rest paid in 15 equal monthly instalments. If the loan is charged an 18% annual interest on the reducing loan balance, calculate the amount of a monthly installment. 4. A motor cycle priced at Rs 150 000 for outright purchase can be bought by making a down payment of Rs 30 000 and paying the rest in 2 years in equal monthly installments. If a 24% annual interest rate is charged on the loan, where the interest is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the amount of a monthly installment. 5. Mr Kumar has acquired a loan of Rs 12 000 which he intends to repay in 6 equal monthly instalments. The amount paid in a monthly installment is Rs 2 100. 6. A refrigerator priced at Rs 36 000 for outright purchase can be bought by making a down payment of Rs 6 000 and paying the rest in 24 equal monthly installments of Rs 1 500. If the interest on the loan is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the annual interest rate. 7. A sewing machine is available at Rs 23 000 for outright purchase. A person going for an installment plan can purchase it by making a down payment of 5 000 and paying the rest in 10 equal monthly installments of Rs 2 000. If the interest on the loan is calculated on the reducing loan balance, find the annual interest rate. An alternative way of calculating interest for an amount of money borrowed or deposited is the compound interest method. Let us explore how the interest is calculated under this method through an example. At a bank that pays an annual interest rate of 10%, the account statement provided at the end of 3 years, to a person who has maintained a Rs 25 000 fixed account is as follows.  (i) Find the amount due from the principal loan amount each month.  (ii) Find the total interest he should pay. (iii) Find the total amount paid in insallments. (iv) What is the number of month units?  (v) Find the interest for a month unit. (vi) Find the annual interst rate.       2014.12.31 2015.01.01 2015.12.31 2016.01.01 interest balance interest balance _ 30 250.00 _ 33 275. 00 2 750.00 _ 3 025.00 _ According to the above statement the depositor has earned Rs 2 500 as interest in the year 2013. It is clear that the interest earned is 10% of the principal deposit. The sum of the money deposited in 2013 and the interest earned in the year 2013 that amounts to 27 500 is considered as the total in the account on 2014.01.01. Furthermore, the interest earned in the year 2014 is 2750 and it is 10% of the total Rs 27500. It is apparent that the interest earned at the end of the year is added to the account balance and the interest for the next year is calculate on the new balance. In this manner, when the interest is calculated every year, not only the principal but the previously earned interest also earns interest. The addition of interest to the principal is called compounding and the interest calculation on the compounded amount is called the compound interest method. The compound interest method can be used when calculating interest on a loan as well as on a deposit. Example 1 If a person takes a loan of Rs 10 000 at a compound interest rate of 10% per year, calculate the total amount required to repay the entire loan in two years.  Interest for the first year = Rs 10 000 10 100  Interest for the second year = Rs 11 000 10 100                           As in the above example, compound interest can be calculated separately for each year and added to the loan amount to find the total loan amount due. Example 2 Amal invests Rs 50 000 for 3 years in a fixed deposit account which pays 6% annual interest compounded yearly. Nimal invests Rs 50 000 in an account which pays 6% annual simple interest. Calculate the amounts received by Amal and Nimal at the end of three years separately. Total amount received by Amal at the end of the first year = Rs 50 000 106 100 Total amount received by Amal at the end of the second year = Rs 53 000 106 100 Total amount received by Amal at the end of the third year = Rs 56 180 106 100 = Rs 50 000 6 100 s 50 000 106 100  106 100  106 100                3. Radha deposits Rs 8 000 in an account paying 12% annual interest compounded yearly. After one year the bank interest rate drops to 10%. How much money will Radha receive in total as interest at the end of 2 years? 4. Hashan and Caseem are two friends. If Hashan lends Rs 25 000 at a simple annual interest rate of 15% and Caseem lends 25 000 at an interest rate of 14% compounded yearly on the same date, calculate who receives more money after three years. 5. At the beginning of a year a person deposits Rs 40 000 in a bank that pays 12% annual interest compounded every six month (semi annually). Compute how much money in total he receives at the end of the year. 6. A person who has loaned a certain amount at 8% interest compounded yearly, receives Rs 432 as compound interest at the end of two years. Find the amount that he loaned. 1. A television is priced at Rs 45 000. A person who buys it outright for cash, receives a discount of 6% and a person going for an instalment plan can make a down payment of Rs 9 000 and pay the remainder in 12 equal monthly instalments. A 24% annual interest rate is charged on the loan, where the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. (a) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought outright for cash? (b) What is the total amount paid if the TV is bought on an instalment plan? (c) How profitable is it to buy the TV outright for cash than on an installment 2. A person takes a loan of Rs 100 000 at an interest rate of 4.2% compounded annually and deposits it in a bank that pays 8% interest compounded annually. What is the profit of his investment after 2 years? 3. A person takes a loan at a certain interest rate compounded annually. If he has to pay Rs 14 400 to settle the entire loan in 2 years or Rs 17 280 to settle it in 3 years, calculate the amount he borrowed and the compound interest rate. In this lesson we will consider businesses in Sri Lanka which are incorporated companies registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. These companies may be owned by an individual or a group of individuals. Of these companies, the companies which are limited by shares can be classified as follows. ² Private limited companies ² Public limited companies Public limited companies raise capital to commence or continue their business by issuing shares or debentures to the general public. The public is notified regarding the issue of shares through the media. When the public buy shares, they have the right to sell these shares to others. The stock market is where the trading of these shares occurs. The Stock Market (Stock Exchange) is a place where securities such as shares and debentures issued by companies are traded. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is the organization responsible for the operation of the stock market in Sri Lanka. The CSE is licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to operate as a stock market in Sri Lanka. The SEC regulates and oversees the stock market. Companies are admitted to the official list of the CSE as listed companies. On April 21st 2015 there were 297 companies listed in the Sri Lankan stock market. The public who wish to buy or sell securities in the stock market must register with one or more of the 15 licensed stockbroker firms of the CSE who attend to the transactions. Some brokers offer trading through the internet. • identify the stock market and its nature • identify terms related to the stock market • calculate the dividends gained by investing in the stock market • solve problems related to shares       Public limited companies which are listed in the stock market, that wish to raise capital by involving the public, do this by issuing “shares”. A share is one of the equal parts into which a company’s stated capital is divided. When a company issues new shares, the price of a share is decided by the company itself. The public can invest in as many shares as they like. An investor who buys shares in a company becomes a part owner of that company. The stake he has in the company is proportional to the number of shares he owns. 10 0 00 100 000 10 0 00 100 000 Company C which has a stated capital of Rs 10 000 000, issues 100 000 shares to the public at Rs 100 per share. Vishwa buys 5000 of these shares.  (b) as a percentage. (ii) Find the amount that Vishwa invested in company C. 5 0 00 100 000           Price of a share (ii)  The number of shares Vishwa purchased The amount Vishwa invested  = Rs 100  = 5 000  = Rs 100 5 000 = Rs 500 000 When a listed company issues new shares, it gives notice of the benefits that shareholders will enjoy. Dividends are payments out of the earnings of the company which some companies give their shareholders as a benefit. It is expressed in terms of the amount paid per share. This is paid out quarterly or annually. For example, a company may pay its shareholders annual dividends of Rs 5 per share. The company has the right to change this amount with time. Let us consider again the above example to clarify this further. Example 1 Company C pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, for the Rs 100 shares it issued, of which Vishwa bought 5 000 shares. (i) Find the annual income that Vishwa receives through this investment. (ii) Express Vishwa’s annual income as a percentage of the amount he  invested. (i) The number of shares Vishwa owns = 5000 Annual dividends per share = Rs 4  ... Vishwa’s annual income = Rs 5000 4  (ii) Amount that Vishwa invested = Rs 100 5 000 = Rs 100 5 000  20 000 50 0 000 Now do the following exercise pertaining to the facts on initial investments in shares.                                             Exercise 10.1 1. An investor purchases 1000 shares of value Rs 25 per share in the company Sasiri  (i) How much did the person invest?  (ii) If the company pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share, find the investor’s 2. Complete the following tables.  (i) Number of shares 2500 Number of shares 500 Annual dividends per share (Rs) 2 3. A public limited company issues 10 000 000 shares to the public at Rs 25 per share to raise its capital. The company pays annual dividends of Rs 5 per share. Sujeeva purchases 50 000 shares in this company.  (i) Find the stated capital of this company.  (ii)  (iii) Find the dividends Sujeeva receives annually through this investment in shares.  (iv) What percent of the amount he invested is the annual dividends he receives?  4. Mehela bought a certain number of shares at Rs 20 per share in a company which pays annual dividends of Rs 3 per share. His dividends income at the end of a year from this investment was Rs 12 000. 5. Ganesh spends exactly half of Rs 100 000 to buy a certain number of Rs 25 shares in a company that pays annual dividends of Rs 4 per share. He decides to deposit the remaining amount in a financial institute which pays an annual interest rate of 12%. Show with reasons, which of the two investments is more advantageous. We learnt earlier that only listed companies are able to trade their shares in the stock market. Let us consider the following note to learn about the trading of shares that is done after a listed company has issued new shares to the public. Nethmi Limited Company which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 per share, issued 100 000 shares to the public at Rs 10 per share at its initial offering. In a year, the value of these shares had increased in the stock market to Rs 20 per share, at which time Nadeesha bought 1000 shares. A few years later, when the price of a share in this company had increased to Rs 28, Nadeesha sold her 1000 shares. The primary market is where investors buy new shares issued by a company. Shares can only be bought in the primary market, and the purchases are done directly from the issuing company at the initial price stated by the company itself. However, subsequent to the original issuance of shares in the primary market, trading of shares can be done by investors in the secondary market. The price of a share in the secondary market is called the market price. The market price of a share varies with time depending on the demand. In the above example, the price of a share in Nethmi Limited Company increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20 in a year and subsequently after several years to Rs 28. Such increases and decreases in the price of a share occur in the secondary market, where investors are able to trade their shares. The price at which a share is bought in a company at the initial offering or later at the market price is called the purchase price of the share and the market price at which it is sold is called the selling price of the share.  (i) Find the number of shares Mahela owns in this company.  (ii) Find the amount Mahela invested to buy shares in this company. if the selling price > purchase price, then he makes a capital gain and the capital gain = selling price – purchase price. if the selling price < purchase price, then the investor incurs a capital loss and the capital loss = purchase price – selling price. Example 1 Mr. Perera who invests in the stock market, bought 2000 shares in a certain company when the market price of a share was Rs 20. When the market price of a share increased to Rs 25, he sold all his shares. (i) Find the amount Mr. Perera invested in the company. (ii) Find the amount he made by selling the shares. (iii) Find his capital gain. (iv) Express his capital gain as a percentage of his investment. = Rs 20 2 000 = Rs 40 000 = Rs 50 000 – 40 000 = Rs10 000 10 0 00 40 000 The capital gain percentage mentioned in (iv) above can be calculated using the price of a share too. Purchase price of a share = Rs 20 Selling price of a share = Rs 25                                       25 – 20 20 5 20 Example 2 Mr. Mohamed spent a certain amount from the Rs 96 000 he had in hand, to buy shares at Rs 18 per share, in Company A which pays annual dividends of Rs 2 per share. He spent the remaining amount to buy shares at Rs 21 per share, in Company B which pays annual dividends of Rs 3.50 per share. At the end of a year he received Rs 1000 more as annual dividends income from Company B, than the amount he received from Company A.  (iii) Find the number of shares he had in each company.  (iv) Find the annual dividends income he received from each company. After receiving the annual income, Mr. Mohamed sold all the shares he owns in both companies at the market price of Rs 20 per share.  (v) Find the total amount he made by selling all his shares in both companies. (vi) Show that Mr. Mohamed’s expectation of making a profit of 20% on his original investments through the dividends income and capital gains was not fulfilled. x  Number of shares bought in company A = 18 x 18 x  9 ( 96 000 – x) 21 ( 96 000 – x) 21                                           3 (96 000 – x ) – 2x = 18 000  288 000 – 3x – 2x = 18 000 288 000 – 18 000 = 5x  270 000 = 5x  x = 54 000  The annual dividends income received from both = Rs 6000 + 7000  companies ... the sum of the amounts received as dividends income and by selling the shares  6  ( 96 000 – x) 6                                                                                                                   Amount invested to buy shares in the two companies = Rs 113 000 – 96 000 = Rs 17 000 17 000 96 000 Amount invested (Rs) Market price of a share (Rs) Number of shares Income from annual dividends of Rs 3 per share (Rs) ...................

On the same coordinate plane, draw the graphs of the following straight lines by calculating the y values corresponding to three selected values of x.  (i) y = x + 1  3. The graphs of four straight lines on a coordinate plane are given below. From the seven given pairs of coordinates, select the ones which correspond to the points P , Q, R and S, which are the intersecting points of the graphs. Give reasons for your answers.    • find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically,  • sketch the graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c,  • analyze the behaviour of a function by considering its graph. You have learnt in previous grades how to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations using algebraic methods. We will now consider how the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations is found by representing the equations graphically.  y – x = – 3 y + 3x = 5  y – x = – 3  y + 3x = 5 1 2  ... 4x = 8  ... x = 2 By substituting x = 2 in 1 we obtain, y – x = – 3    ... y = – 3 + 2  ... y = – 1 When these two equations are considered separately, they can be written as y = x – 3 and y = – 3x + 5 by making y the subject. Let us first draw the graphs of these straight lines on the same coordinate plane. Two tables of values corresponding to these equations are given below. x y  1 – 2 2 – 1 3 0 x y 1 2 2 3 – 1 – 4                               The graphs of the straight lines drawn on the same coordinate plane using the above tables of values intersect each other at the point (2, – 1). When the x and y values corresponding this point are substituted into the given pair of equations, it can be observed that the two sides of the equations are equal. That is, the coordinates x = 2 and y = – 1 of the intersection point of these graphs is the solution to the given pair of simultaneous equations. 0 –1 This geometric solution to the pair of simultaneous equations is further established by the fact that the same solution was obtained algebraically too. Accordingly, to find the solution to a pair of simultaneous equations graphically, the straight lines corresponding to the pair of equations should be drawn on the same coordinate plane, and the coordinates of the point of intersection of the graphs should be found. Then the x and y values of the solution are obtained from the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate respectively of the point of intersection. In the following example, the method of constructing a pair of simultaneous equations and solving it graphically is considered. A person buys 10 stamps, some of value Rs 10 and the rest of value Rs 20. The total value of the stamps is Rs 120.  (i) By taking the number of stamps of value Rs 10 that he bought as x and the number of stamps of value Rs 20 as y, construct a pair of simultaneous equations.  x + y = 10 10x + 20y = 120 1 2     x y 2 5 4 4 6 3 Let us represent each of the equations graphically.  x + y = 10; that is, y = – x + 10 4 6 2 8 6 4 x  
y When equations x + y = 10 and 10x + 20y = 120 are represented they intersect each other at the point (8, 2). Therefore, the solution to the pair of equations is x = 8 and y = 2. That is, the person bought eight Rs 10 stamps and two Rs 20 stamps. Exercise 12.1 1. Solve each of the following pairs of simultaneous equations graphically. Verify 2. A certain school has two Grade 11 classes A and B. If five students from class A move to class B, then the number of students in class B will be twice the number of students in class A.

(ii) Draw the graphs of the pair of equations on the same coordinate plane and hence find the number of students in class A and in class B separately. your answers by solving the equations algebraically too.  a. y – x = 4  y – 2x = 3  b. y = – 2x – 2  – 2y = – x – 6  c. 3x – 4y = 7  5x + 2y = 3  Do the following exercise to recall what you have learnt in Grade 10 regarding the graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 and y = ax2 + b. x y – 3  4 2 0 – 2 – 1 ___ – 4 – 5 ___ – 1 3 4  a.

(vii) Obtain an approximate value for 2, to the first decimal place. Let us first consider how we can use the knowledge we have gained on the characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + b to study the characteristics of graphs of quadratic functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c. Drawing graphs of functions of the form y = ax2 + bx + c for a > 0 and identifying their characteristics To identify some basic characteristics, let us first draw the graph of the function y = x2 – 2x – 3. To do this, let us prepare a table as follows to obtain the values of y corresponding to the values of x for – 2 < x < 4. x x2 – 2x – 3 y – 2 4 4 – 3 5 – 1 1 2 – 3 0 (– 1, 0) 0 0 0 – 3 – 3 (0, – 3) 1 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 (1, – 4) 2 4 – 4 – 3 – 3 (2, – 3) 3 9 – 6 – 3 0 (3, 0) 4 16 – 8 – 3 5 (4, 5) Before drawing the graph, it is important to consider the range of values that x and y take and prepare the coordinate plane accordingly. It is easy to draw the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 by taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale.

Therefore, the equation of the axis As the value of x increases gradually from – 2, the corresponding y value decreases gradually until it attains its minimum value – 4 and then starts increasing again. Let us describe the behaviour of y further for the given range of values of x. • As the value of x increases from – 2 to – 1, the value of y, that is, the value of the function decreases positively from 5 to 0. What is meant by “decreases positively” is that the function decreases while remaining positive. • The function takes the value 0 when x = – 1. • As the value of x increases from – 1 to 1, the corresponding y value decreases • The function takes the value 0 when x = 3. • As the value of x increases from 3, the value of y increases positively. By considering the above characteristics, the range of values of x for which the function is negative can be expressed in terms of inequalities as – 1 < x < 3.  0 – 1 • The value of y is positive when the value of x is less than – 1 or greater than 3. That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is x < – 1 and x > 3. This can be described as follows.  (1) If any point (a, b) lies on the graph, then the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3 is satisfied It is extremely important to keep the above two facts in mind. Clearly the point (– 1, 0) lies on the graph. Therefore, x = – 1 and y = 0 should satisfy the equation y = x2 – 2x – 3. That is, 0 = (– 1)2 – 2 (– 1) – 3. This can be verified by simplifying the right hand side. Another way of stating this is that x = – 1 is a root of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0. By the same argument it can be stated that x = 3 is also a root of this equation. That is, the roots of the equation x2 – 2x – 3 = 0 are the x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = x2 – 2x – 3 intersects the x- axis. This can be written more generally as follows. The x coordinates of the points at which the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x - axis are the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. • The minimum value of the function is obtained at the turning point of the graph. The minimum value is – 4. The coordinates of the minimum point are (1,– 4). Let us prepare a table as follows for – 4 < x < 2 to draw the graph of the function y = – x2 – 2x + 6. x – x2 – 2x + 6 y – 4 – 16  8 + 6 – 2 – 3 – 9 6 + 6 3 – 2 – 4 4 + 6 6 – 1 – 1  2 + 6 7 0 0 0 + 6 6 1 – 1 – 2 + 6 3 2 – 4 – 4 + 6 – 2 By considering the range of values of x and y, and selecting 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small division along the y axis to be two units as scale, the graph of the given function can be drawn as follows. • The graph which has a maximum value 7 is symmetric about the line x = – 1. • Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph is x = – 1. • The coordinates of the turning point are (– 1, 7). • As the value of x increases from – 4 to – 3.6, the value of y increases negatively. • The function takes the value 0 when x = – 3.6. • As the value of x increases from – 3.6 to – 1, the corresponding y value increases • The function attains its maximum value of + 7 when the value of x is – 1. • As the value of x increases from – 1 to + 1.6, the value of the function decreases • The function takes the value 0 when x = + 1.6. • As the value of x increases from + 1.6, the value of y decreases negatively. • When the value of x lies between – 3.6 and + 1.6, the value of the function is positive. That is, the range of values of x for which the function is positive is – 3.6 < x < + 1.6. • When the value of x is less than – 3.6 or greater than + 1.6, the function is negative. • That is, the range of values of x for which the function is negative is x < – 3.6 and  0 – 1 • The graph intersects the line y = 0 (x-axis) when x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6. Therefore, the values of x which satisfy the equation – x2 – 2x + 6 = 0, that is, the roots of this equation are x = – 3.6 and x = + 1.6.

Here the quadratic function has been expressed in the special form y = + (x + b)2 + c. When it is written in this form, some of the characteristics of its graph can be inferred without drawing the graph. Several such characteristic are given in the following table.

Let us consider the function y = (x + 1)2 – 2. This is of the form y = (x + b)2 + c where b = 1 and c = – 2. To draw the graph of this function for the values of x from – 4 to + 2, let us calculate the necessary values of y as shown in the following table. x (x + 1)2 – 2 y (x, y) – 4 9 – 2 7 (– 4, 7) – 3 4 – 2 2 (– 3, 2) – 2 1 – 2 – 1 (– 2, – 1) – 1 0  – 2 – 2 (– 1, – 2) 0 1 – 2 – 1 (0, – 1) 1 4 – 2 2 (1, 2) 2 9 – 2 7 (2, 7) By taking 10 small divisions along the x-axis to be one unit and 10 small divisions along the y-axis to be two units as scale, the graph of the given function can be drawn as follows. Note: This graph has a minimum point. The minimum value of the function is – 2 (= c). The coordinates of the minimum point are (– 1, – 2), that is, ( – b, c). The axis of symmetry is x = – 1 (That is, x = – b). When a quadratic function has been given in the form x = + (x + b)2 – c, the graph can be sketched using the characteristics in the above table. The example given below explains how this is done. 46  0 – 1  Example 1 Sketch the graph of y = – (x – 2)2 + 3. Since the coefficient of (x – 2)2 is negative, the turning point of the graph is a maximum. The coordinates of this maximum point is (2, 3). The axis of symmetry of the graph is x = 2. Further, to find the point at which the graph intersects the y-axis, let us substitute x = 0 in y = – (x – 2)2 + 3. We then obtain y = – (0 – 2)2 + 3 = – 1. Accordingly, we can sketch the graph as follows.

The function has been written in the special form y = x + (x + a) (x + b). As in the above case, when the function is given in this form, certain characteristics of the graph of the function can be inferred without sketching the graph. The following table provides several such characteristics. Equation of the function Nature of the turning point The coordinates of the maximum/ minimum point Equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph The points at which the function intersects the x-axis The point at which the function intersects the y-axis Let us consider y = – (x – 1) (x – 4). This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b) where a = – 1 and b = – 4. To draw the graph of this function, let us prepare a table of (x, y) values as follows. (i) y = (x – 2)2 – 3 (ii) y = 2 – (x + 5)2 (iii) y = x2 + 6x – 1  b. Equation of the axis of symmetry a. Nature of the graph  c. Maximum/minimum value d.

When a quadratic function is given in the form y = + (x + a) (x + b), its graph can be sketched by considering the characteristics given in the table. Example 1 Sketch the graph of y = – (x + 3) (x – 1). This is of the form y = – (x + a) (x + b), where a = 3 and b = – 1 Since the coefficient of x2 is negative, the turning point is a maximum.

(i) Express the given information in two equations. (ii) How many of each type of coin does he have?   3. Malini and Nalini have a certain amount of money. When you add Rs 30 to the sum of the amounts Malini and Nalini have, the total amounts to Rs 175. Nalini has Rs 95 less than twice the amount Malini has. Let Rs x be the amount of money Malini has and Rs y be the amount of money Nalini has,  (i) Express the given information in two equations. (ii) How much does each person actually have?   4. ‘‘It costs Rs 65 to buy two books and a pen.You can buy one such book at the cost of two such pens.” Construct two simultaneous equations to represent this information and solve them to find the price of a book and a pen separately.  a. 6x + 2y = 1  4x – y = 3  d. 9p – 2q = 13  7p – 3q = 0  b. a + 2b = 3  2a + 3b = 4  e. 2x + 3y = 12  3x – 4y = 1  c. m – 4n = 6  3m + 2n = 4  f. 3a + 12 = 2b  13 + 2a = 3b  • construct simultaneous equations with rational coefficients, • solve simultaneous equations with rational coefficients, • solve quadratic equations by means of factoring, completing the square and We have learnt before how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have integers as coefficients. Now we will explore through an example, how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations when the unknowns have fractions as coefficients. Kamal and Nimal have a certain amount of money. When you add 1 2 Kamal has to 1 3 has is equal to 1 6 separately.  of the amount Nimal has to get Rs 20. If 1 4 Let us take the amount Kamal has as when you add 1 2  y, you get 1 is, 1 2 3  x + 1 3  of what Kamal has, that is, Rs 1 2  x to 1 3 Similarly , since 1 4  th of what Kamal has is equal to 1 6  x = 1 6  x + 1 3  1 4  x – 1 6 When solving simultaneous equations involving fractions, it often helps to first clear the fractions and work with only integers. To clear the fractions we have to multiply each side of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators. Therefore, equation 1 is multiplied by 6 which is the the least common multiple of the denominators 2, and 3 and equation 2 is multiplied by 12 which is the least common multiple of the denominators 6 and 4.     Now instead of 1 and 2 we can solve the two equivalent equations 3 and 4 involving only integers. 3 + 4 (3x + 2y) + (3x – 2y) = 120 + 0  3x + 2y + 3x – 2y = 120 6x 120 6 = 6  x = 20  
                    
 
 
 3 20 – 2y = 0 2y = 60 ... The amount Kamal has = Rs 20  The amount Nimal has = Rs 30 Note: In this problem, once we converted the fractions into integers, we solved for the unknown x by adding the equations. Alternatively we can make one unknown the subject of one equation and substitute in the other equation to obtain the solution. We will discuss one such example now. The following steps will demonstrate how to solve simultaneous equations by substitution.  a – 1 5  a + 1 4  1 6; 6 1 2  x + 6 1 3 2 12; 12 1 4  ∴ 3x + 2y = 120  x – 12 1 6                      a = – 2 + 1  b 5  a = – 12 + 6 5 We will simplify the fractions by taking 20 as the common denominator which is the least common multiple of 4 and 5. We will substitute the value of a in equation 2 .  a + 1  1 3 4  b) + 1 4  b + 1 4  1 3  
 
 
 1 6  a – 1 5  8 20 b+ 5 20  13 b = 13 20  b = 13 20  13 Substituting b = 20 in equation 3 (here you can substitute the value of b in either equation to find a), we get  a = – 12 + 6 5 a = – 12 + 6 5  a = – 12 + 24 a = 12 Therefore the solution to the problem is a = 12 and b = 20. We can verify that the solution is correct by substituting a = 12 and b = 20 in the original equations. Let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation 1 .                          The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution. That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation 1 6  a – 1 5 Similarly, let us substitute a = 12 and b = 20 in the left side of equation 2 .  1 6  a – 1 5 = 2 – 4 = – 2 The left hand side equals the right hand side of the equation after the substitution.  a + 1 That means a = 12 and b = 20 satisfy the equation 1 4 3 Therefore we can conclude that we have the correct answer. = 4 + 5 = 9  m + 2 3  m + 1 3  1 3  a + 1 4 Let us take:  m + 2 3  m + 1 3               As in example 1 we can either convert the fractions into integers or we can equate the fractional coefficients of a variable to solve the problem. Let us equate the coefficients of the unknown n. We can do this by multiplying equation 2 by 2  7 m = 7 6  m = 6 Let us substitute m = 6 in 1 .  m + 2  1 3 2  6 + 2  1 2 3  3 + 2 3  2 3  2 3  
 
 
 
 
 2n = – 6  n = – 3 As in the previous problem, we can verify that the solution is correct by substituting the answers in the original equations.  m + 2 3  m – 2 3  1 2  1 2 10 6  3 6  7 6 10 6  2 2 10 6  m + 2 3  m + 2 3 10 6                          = 5 – 1  = 4  m + 1 3 Left hand side = 5 6  m + 2 3  m + 2 3 Left hand side = 1 2  = 1 2  = 3 – 2  = 1

(ii) Solving the equations find the area of land owned by each person.                       You have learnt how to find the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 Let us review a few a such examples. Example1  Find the roots of the quadratic equation x2 – 5x + 6 = 0.  (x – 2) (x – 3) = 0 (by factoring)  Then either x – 2 = 0 or x – 3 = 0. Therefore x = 2 or x = 3 Find the roots of 2x2 + 3x – 9 = 0  2x2 + 6x – 3x – 9 = 0  2x (x + 3) – 3 (x + 3) = 0 Here we cannot see the quadratic equation immediately. But when we clear the fractions, it can be set up as a quadratic equation. For this, we will consider the common denominator of the left hand side.(You can also do this by multiplying the whole equation by the least common multiple of 2x – 1 and 3x + 2)  3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1)  (2x – 1) (3x + 2) 3 2x – 1 2 3x + 2          3(3x + 2) – 2(2x – 1) = (2x – 1) (3x + 2) (cross multiplying)  9x + 6 – 4x + 2 = 6x2 + 4x – 3x – 2 (expanding the factors)  6x2 – 4x – 10 = 0 (simplifying)  3x2 – 2x – 5 = 0 (dividing the whole equation by 2)  3x2 – 5x + 3x – 5 = 0  x (3x – 5) + 1 (3x – 5) = 0  (3x – 5) (x + 1) = 0  ... 3x – 5 = 0 or x + 1 = 0  or x = – 1  ... x =  ... x = 1  ... x = 1 Let us see how we can set up a quadratic equation to solve this problem. Of the two consecutive integers, let us take x to be the smaller integer. Then the other integer is x + 1. Therefore the consecutive integers can be written as x, (x + 1) . Since the product of the two numbers is 12 we get,  x (x + 1) = 12.  ... x2 + x – 12 = 0  (x – 3) (x + 4) = 0. This is, x – 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0.  ... x = 3 and x = – 4 are the solutions of the above equation. If we take x = 3 then the consecutive number is (x + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4. If we take x = – 4 the consecutive number is (x + 1) = – 4 + 1 = – 3. Therefore there are two pairs of consecutive numbers whose product will be 12. They are 3, 4 and – 4, – 3. We can verify the answer by substituting the two pairs of values in the quadratic equation x2 + x – 12 = 0.     If we substitute x = 3 on the left hand side of x2 + x – 12 = 0,  LHS = x2 + x – 12  = 32 + 3 – 12  = 9 + 3 – 12  = 12 – 12  = 0  ... LHS = RHS If we substitute x = – 4 on the left hand side,  LHS = x2 + x – 12      = (– 4)2 + (– 4) – 12  = 16 – 4 – 12  = 16 – 16  = 0 ... LHS = RHS The area of a rectangular plot of land is 150 square metres. The length of the plot is 5 metres more than the width. Let x be the width of the plot.  (i) Write the length of the plot in terms of x.  (ii) Set up a quadratic equation in x to represent the area of the plot x. (iii) Solve the equation to find the length and the width of the plot.  (i) Length = x + 5. (ii) The given data can be shown more clearly by aid of a drawing.  x (x + 5) = 150 This is the required equation. (iii) Let us solve the above equation.   x2 + 5x – 150 = 0  (x – 10) (x + 15) = 0                                     ... x – 10 = 0 or x + 15 = 0  ... x = + 10 or x = – 15 The roots of the quadratic equation are x = + 10 and x = – 15. But since a length cannot be negative, the only acceptable answer is x = 10. Therefore the width of the rectangular plot = 10 m The length of the rectangular plot = 15 m  We can verify the answer by substituting x = 10 in the quadratic equation x2 + 5x – 150 = 0.  = 10 (10 + 5)  = 10 15  = 150 ... LHS = RHS  (b) 3 4  (e) x2 2 3 x +1  (h) 4 x 3 x +1 = 3                  6. A playing field measuring, 32 metres by 20 metres has a pathway outside the field all around it, of uniform width. The area of the pathway is 285 square metres. 7. The hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is 2x + 1 cm. The lengths of the other two sides are x cm and x + 7 cm respectively. Solve for x and find the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. We have seen how to solve a quadratic equation by factorization. This method is useful only when the factorization is easy to do. Many quadratic expressions, such as x2 + 3x + 5 = 0 and 2x2 – 5x –1 = 0 cannot be factorized easily.To solve such quadratic equations we have to use alternative methods.One such method is to arrange the quadratic as a perfect square. This is known as solving the quadratic equation by completing the square. Before we proceed, let us recall how we learnt to write an expression of the form x2 + bx as a perfect square. Activity Write the constant you should include to convert each of the following expressions into a perfect square and write it as a perfect square. a. x2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)2 b. x2 + 8x + ... = ............ c. x2 – 14x + ... = ............ d. x2 + 3x + ... = ............ e. (x + ...)2 = x2 + 8x + ... f. (x + ...)2 = x2 + 2ax + ... g. (x + b)2 = x2 + ...x + b2    h. (x + m)2 = x2 + ...x + m2 First we will complete the square of a quadratic equation which can also be solved by factoring. Example 1 Solve x2 + 2x – 3 = 0 by completing the square. First we will keep all terms containing x on one side and move the constant to the right. Then we get  x2 + 2x – 3 = 0  x2 + 2x = 3 To write the left hand side as a perfect square, take half of the x-term coefficient and square it and add this value to both sides. That is, in this problem we have to add +1 to both sides.  x2 + 2x + 1 = 3 + 1  (x + 1)2 = 4 Take the square root of both sides. We have to allow for both positive and negative values. Then x = + 2 – 1 or x = – 2 – 1  x = 1 or x = – 3 Therefore the solutions to the above equation are x = 1 and x = – 3.  x2 – 4x + 1 = 0  x2 – 4x – 1  x2 – 4x + 4 = – 1 + 4  (x – 2)2 = 3  x – 2 = + 3 ^taking the square root of both sides)       x = 2 + 3  x = 2 + 3 or x = 2 – 3.  Suppose it is given that 3 is approximately 1.73  Then x = 2 + 1.73 or x = 2 – 1.73                     Then the solutions of this equation are x = 3.73 and x = 0.27. Example 3 Here it is easy if we first divide all the terms by 2 to make the leading coefficient (coefficient of the x2 term) one. 4.36 – 3 2  x = 0.68 or x = – 3.68 The roots of the equation are x = 0.68 and x = – 3.68.   (Take 2 = 1.41, 3 = 1.73, 5 = 2.23, 6 = 2.44, 13= 3.6, 17 = 4.12 and 57 = 7.54) – 19 – 3  2  2 Suppose 4.36 is given as an approximate value of 19 . +19 4  x + 3 2  = + 19 2 2x2 + 6x – 5 = 0  x2 + 3x – +10 + 9 4                   (d) x2 + 4x – 8 = 0  (g) 2x2 + 5x = 4 An easy method of solving a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is by using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is derived by completing the square on a general quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. Once the quadratic formula is derived, it is no longer necessary to use the process of completing the square to solve "each" quadratic equation. a ^writing the left hand side as a perfect square and arranging the terms on the right hand  ax2 + bx = – c ax2 a + bx a = – c a ^ dividing by a& a x = – c  x2 + b a 2b 2a = – c a + b b2 4a2 – c 2a 2b

Therefore AQ : QC = 1 : 5 can be also written as AQ QC Let us do the following activity to find out about the ratios in which two sides of a triangle are divided by a line drawn parallel to the other side. • Mark the points P and Q on AB such that AP = 2 cm and AQ = 3 cm. • Using the set square or using any other method, draw a line through Q parallel to • Measure AR and RC. • Similarly draw another line parallel to BC through P and mark the point that it • Measure AS and SC. • Now complete the following table.      • Similarly check the relationship between the ratios in which the two sides of a right angled triangle and obtuse angled triangle are divided by a line drawn parallel to the other side. A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in equal ratios. A line drawn parallel to a side of a triangle divides the other two sides proportionally. As an example, the line AB drawn parallel to the side PR of the triangle PQR is shown in the figure. Then according to the theorem, QA AP = QB BR . >  Figure (iii) As shown in figure (i), the line PQ drawn parallel to BC internally divides the sides AB and AC. But in figure (ii) and figure (iii), the line PQ, drawn parallel to BC meets other two sides produced at P and Q.

Irrespective of whether the sides are divided internally or externally, the theorem is valid. AP PB = AQ QC ' In triangle PQR, the line XY is drawn parallel to PR. Find the length of RY if PX = 4 cm, XQ = 2 cm, and YQ = 3 cm. Let x be the length of RY. Then, since XY is drawn parallel to PR, RY YQ PX XQ  hence  ... 2x = 4 3  ... x = 6

Here, as in the above example, choose two triangles and in each triangle draw a line parallel to a relevant side of the triangle. We choose triangles ABE and ABC, because there is a common side to these two triangles. But there is no line parallel to a side of the ABC triangle.

That is, since BC//DE, AD : DB = AE : EC. Let us understand the converse of this theorem by considering the triangle PQR shown in the figure. Here the line AB intersects the sides PQ and PR. The ratios of the line segments of each side are PA : AQ and PB : BR. If these two ratios are equal, that is, if PA : AQ = PB : BR then the line AB, which intersects those two sides at P and Q, is parallel to the other side QR. This is the converse of the theorem we have already learnt in this lesson. This result can be stated as a theorem. Given below are some examples with calculations and proved riders related to the theorem. The converse of the above theorem: If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then that line is parallel to the other side.                                                                          AE : EC = 6 : 4.5 = 4 : 3.  ... AD : DB = AE : EC  ... The line DE divides AB and AC proportionally.  ... By the converse of the theorem, DE//BC.   But AD : DB = 4 : 3 Hence AX : XF = 4 : 3 C The point P lies on the side AB of the quadrilateral ABCD. The line drawn through P, parallel to AC, meets BC at Q. Similarly, the line drawn through P, parallel to AD, meets BD at R. Prove that RQ//DC.          2. In triangle ABC, the point P lies on the side AB and the point Q lies on the side  = 180x . 4. In the quadrilateral ABCD given in the figure, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at K. If AK = 4.8 cm,  KC = 3.2 cm, BK = 3 cm and KD = 2 cm, then show that DC is parallel to AB.(Hint: In triangle KDC, take  that the points A and B lie on DK and CK produced                                                           In day to day language we say that these three triangles are of the "same shape". The following figure illustrates three quadrilaterals and three pentagons of the same shape. But the following pair of triangles as well as pair of quadrilaterals are not of the same shape. Did you think of what is meant by "shape" here? In mathematics things should be defined precisely. It is necessary to give a precise definition for —shape˜. —Similar figure˜ is the phrase in mathematics equivalent to —same shape˜ in day to day language. Here we consider only the similarity of polygons. 5. In the triangle ABC given in the figure, the midpoint of the side BC is D. The point O lies on AD. BO produced intersects AC at P and CO produced intersects AB at Q. The line AD is produced to R such that OD = DR. Prove that,  (i) BRCO is a parallelogram.  (ii) AQ : QB = AO : OR.  (iii) QP//BC.     1. the angles of one polygon are equal to the angles of the other and, 2. the corresponding sides of the polygons are proportional. , B BC QR = , C CD RS = , D DA SP , AB PQ = In this lesson we hope to study more about similar triangles. In the two triangles ABC and PQR given below,  = P AB PQ =  = Q BC QR = C  = R CA RP , then by definition the two triangles are similar.  There is an important result related to the similarity of triangles. That is, if the angles of one triangle are equal to the angles of another triangle, then those two triangles are similar. In otherwords, if three angles of a triangle are equal to the three angles of another triangle then the corresponding sides of those two triangles are proportional. Therefore to find out whether two triangles are similar, it is sufficient to check only the angles of the two triangles. As an example, in the above two AB PQ = BC QR = CA RP '       This result is not true for polygons which are not triangles. For example, in the following two quadrilaterals, the angles of one quadrilateral are equal to the angles of the other quadrilateral. Each of these angles is 90x. However one of the quadrilaterals is a rectangle and the other is a square. Therefore their sides are not proportional and hence the two quadrilaterals are not similar. If the angles of two polygons are equal, then those polygons are said to be equiangular. According to the above discussion, two equiangular triangles are similar too. Let us use this result as a theorem without proof. ² Using the protractor, draw two different sized triangles, each with interior angles x, 50x and 90x . As shown below, name the triangles as ABC and PQR . According to the above activity, you can understand that if two triangles are equiangular then they are similar. AB PQ , BC QR and CA RP separately.  Theorem on equiangular triangles: If two triangles are equiangular then the corresponding sides are proportional.   Note: 1.If restricted to triangles, similar and equi-angular mean the same thing. 2.It is clear that two congruent triangles are similar. But two similar triangles may  not be congruent. 3. If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then the remaining pair of angles are also equal to each other. The reason for this is because the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180x. Therefore, if two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, then they are equiangular. Example 1 In the two triangles ABC and PQR in the figure, A of x and y in the triangle PQR.  and B  = R P  = R ... C ... The triangles ABC and PQR are equiangular. ...

(i) Show that the triangles ABC and APQ are equiangular.  (ii) Find the values of x and y .                5 cm 40x 4 cm S    Next we investigate the converse of the above theorem. That is, to find whether the statement "if the sides of two triangles are proportional then those triangles are equiangular" is true .This converse is true and we can state this result as a theorem. Also, if the three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three sides of another triangle then the two triangles are said to be similar. ² Construct the triangle ABC with AB = 2.5 cm, BC = 3 cm and AC = 3.5 cm. ² Construct the triangle PQR with PQ = 5 cm, QR = 6 cm and PR = 7 cm. hrough this activity you may have observed that the corresponding sides of the two triangles are proportional and also that the angles of ABC are equal to the angles of PQR. This result can be expressed as the converse theorem of the theorem which we learnt about equiangular triangles earlier. AB PQ , BC QR , AC PR ' ² Measure the angles of each triangles separately. ² What type of triangles are ABC and PQR?

According to the lengths of the sides given in the figure, show with reasons that the triangles ABC and PQR are equiangular. Name the equal angles. PQ AB = RQ CA = PR BC = Since these ratios are equal, according to the converse theorem, the triangles PQR and ABC are equiangular. Do the following exercise using the converse theorem — if corresponding sides are proportional then the triangles are equiangular˜                (iv) J AB EF = AC ED = BC DF ' Name an " ABC 3.

In triangle ABC, PQ drawn parallel to BC meets the side AB at P and the side AC at Q. The lines CP and BQ intersect each other at S. SR drawn parallel to AB meets BC at R. BR RC = AQ AC '   Data Representation and Interpretation We know that the range is the value which is obtained by subtracting the least value of the data from the highest value of the data. Therefore, To facilitate interpretation, a group of data is often represented as a frequency distribution. We know that if the range of the data is large, then the data is divided into class intervals. Such a frequency distribution is called a grouped frequency distrbution. In such frequency distributions, generally, the number of class intervals should be between 5 and 10. The size of a class interval is determined by dividing the range of the frequency distribution by the number of class intervals and taking the least integer greater than that value . For example let us group the above data into 6 class intervals. To find the size of a class interval, first divide 28 (the range) by 6 (number of class intervals). 28  6 4.66 ' Hence the size of each interval should be 5, which is the least integer greater than 4.66. 100 By studying this lesson, you will be able to  ² find the limits and boundaries of the intervals of a frequency distribution  ² draw the relevant histogram  ² draw the relevant frequency polygon  ² draw the relevant cumulative frequency curve and find the inter quartile              Next the first class interval needs to be selected. Since the lowest value of the data is 130, the first class interval should start from 130. The following are two different grouped frequency distributions from the given data. 130 -135 135 - 140 140 - 145 145 - 150 150 - 155 155 - 160 3 7 10 5 3 2 130 -134 135 - 139 140 - 144 145 - 149 150 - 154 155 - 159 3 7 10 5 3 2 Consider the first grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 135 class interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than 135. The second class interval 135 - 140 represents the heights greater than or equal to 135 and less than 140. The other class intervals can be described similarly. Now consider the second grouped distribution. As an example, the 130 - 134 class interval represents the heights greater than or equal to 130 and less than or equal to 134. Let us observe another difference between these two distributions. In the first distribution there are no gaps between the class intervals. For example, the class interval 135 - 140 starts from the upper limit 135 of the previous class interval 130 - 135. So there is a common limit for these class intervals. But this is not so in the second distribution. For example 134 is the upper limit of the class interval 130-134, but the next class interval starts from 135. The gap between these two limits is 1. In the next section of this lesson we hope to learn how to draw histograms. To draw a histogram, there should not be these kinds of gaps. Therefore we must change the second distribution appropriately. This change can be done by introducing a common boundary for the class intervals. That common boundary can be determined easily. For example, in the second distribution, 134.5 is taken as the boundary of the class intervals 130 - 134 and 135 - 139, which is the exact middle of the upper limit (134) of the class interval 130 - 134 and the lower limit (135) of the class interval 135 - 139.The new distribution constructed in this way is given below.     129.5 - 134.5 134.5 - 139.5 139.5 - 144.5 144.5 - 149.5 149.5 - 154.5 154.5 - 159.5 3 7 10 5 3 2 Here observe that, 0.5 is subtracted from the lower limits and 0.5 is added to the upper limits of every class interval of the original distribution.This rule is valid for the first and last class intervals too. The values 129.5 and 159.5 are obtained in that way. Also observe that, the size of the class interval of this new distribution is 5. In the above, the first kind of distribution is simple. But practically, the second kind of distribution can be constructed easily. Both kinds of distributions can be found in statistics. Let us consider how to draw the histogram of a grouped frequency distribution. A histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution. In a histogram, the frequencies of class intervals are represented by the heights of the rectangular columns which touch each other. Let us consider first, how to draw the histogram if the sizes of the class intervals are equal.(As in the example in the previous section). When drawing the histogram, follow the steps given below. ² Mark the boundaries of the calss intervals on the horizontal axis drawn to an appropriate scale.  Along the vertical axis, on an appropriate scale, draw the columns such that the height of the column on a class interval is the corresponding frequency. Draw the histogram of the grouped frequency distribution prepared in the previous section.                  129.5 - 134.5 134.5 - 139.5 139.5 - 144.5 144.5 - 149.5 149.5 - 154.5 154.5 - 159.5 The relevant histogram is given below. Two small squares along the horizontal axis represents 1 centimetre. Five small squares along the vertical axis represents two children. Note: Since the data starts from 129.5, it is not necessary to show the class intervals from 0 to 129.5 in the histogram. The mark at the beginning of the x axis indicates that the axis has been shrunk in this region. The following is a frequency distribution of the Mathematics marks of students taken from a School Based Assessment.   Class intervals (Marks Obtained) Frequency (Number of children) As an example, the interval 0 - 10 represents the marks greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10. The other class intervals are defined similarly. Draw the histogram of the frequency distribution. In this frequency distribution, the first class interval ends at 10 and next class interval starts at 10.This histogram can be drawn easily. Now let us consider how to draw a histogram of a frequency distribution with different sized class intervals. A frequency distribution based on the marks of 40 students in a term test is given below. Class intervals (Marks Obtained) Frequency (Number of students) If you observe the class intervals, you can see that the sizes of the class intervals are not the same. The size of each of the first 5 class intervals is 10 and the sizes of the next two class intervals are 20 and 30 respectively. Another important feature in a histogram is that the areas of the columns are proportional to the relevant frequencies. 104  Therefore if the sizes of the class intervals are equal, then the frequencies are proportional to the heights of the columns. Hence in the above examples 1 and 2, the frequency can be identified directly with the height of the column. But in this example, since the sizes of the class intervals are not the same, the frequency cannot be identified directly with the height of the column. The heights of the columns should be obtained such that the areas of the columns are proportional to the frequences. This can be done as follows. In this frequency distribution, the size of all but the class intervals 50 - 70 and 70 - 100 is 10. The size of the class interval 50 - 70 is 20 and the size of the class interval 70 - 100 is 30. Hence the size of the smallest class interval is 10 and the size of the class interval 50 - 70 is two times that. Since the area of the column which represents the frequency of the class interval should be proportional to the frequency, frequency 2     The size of the class interval 70 - 100 is three times the size of the smallest class interval. ... The height the column of the 70 - 100 class interval =             1. The frequency distribution prepared from the data collected by a weather forecasting center in a certain area is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Rainfall in a week in mm. Number of weeks in the year 2015 is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Class intervals ^Number of books issued& Frequency (Number of days) 3. The frequency distribution prepared from the data obtained by measuring the circumference of teak trees in a forest plantation is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Circumference of a tree (cm) 4. The frequency distribution prepared from the data on the daily consumption of water provieded through rural water project to 60 houses is given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. Home usage of water (Litres) Number of houses 5. The information on the monthly electricity consumption of 75 houses in January 2015 is shown in the table given below. Illustrate this information in a histogram. A frequency polygon is a graphical representation of grouped data similar to a histogram. There are two methods to construct frequency polygons. ² From the histogram of the frequency distribution ² From the mid-values and frequencies of the class intervals In the following example, let us consider first, how to construct a frequency polygon from the histogram.  (i) First draw the histogram relevant to the given information  (ii) In each column in the histogram, mark the sign — ˜ at the middle of the top of the column. (See the following figure; the signs — ˜ denoted as A, B, C, D and E ) Class intervals (Units of electricity) Frequency (Number of houses) 6. The following frequency distribution shows the information on the number of telephone calls and the time duration of each telephone call on a certain day at a communication centre. Time duration of one telephone call (seconds)       (iii) Join these — ˜signs by the line segments as shown in the figure. (iv) On the horizontal axis, mark half the length of the class interval to the right of the last class interval and to the left of the first class interval (hence 5 units)' Join E F and A G. Now you get the polygon ABCDEFG. This polygon is called the frequency polygon of the frequency distribution. If you observe carefully, you can see that the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of the columns of the histogram. To draw a frequency polygon, it is not necessary to draw the histogram first. The frequency polygon can be drawn directly by using the mid-values of the class intervals and using the relevant frequencies. The following example shows how to draw the frequency polygon using this method. From the given frequency distribution, prepare a table with the mid-values of the class intervals to draw the frequency polygon. Class interval 0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 Mid-value 5 15 25 35 45 Mark the mid-values of the class intervals along the horizontal axis and mark the frequencies along the vertical axis. Then mark the corresponding points. The frequency polygon can be obtained by joining those points respectively by line segments. 108 Let us consider next, how to draw a frequency polygon with unequal sized class intervals. Class intervals (Obtained marks) Frequency (Number of students) Let us draw the frequency polygon for the above frequency distribution with unequal sized class intervals. 50 60 Marks Here, the class interval 50 - 60 of size 20 is divided in to two class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Similarly the class interval 70 - 100 of size 30 is divided in  to three class intervals of size 10 and as the relevant frequency, the frequency of the mid-point of each class interval is considered. Also in this case, observe that the area of the frequency polygon is equal to the sum of the areas of columns of the histogram. 1. The frequency distribution prepared from the data collected by measuring the masses of students who attended a medical clinic of a school is given below. Mass of a student (kg) Number of students  (i) Illustrate this information in a histogram.  (ii) Draw the frequency polygon on this histogram. 2. The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the data collected through a test conducted to determine the life time of bulbs manufactured by a company. Class intervals (No. of hours the bulb lighted) Frequency (Number of bulbs)  (i) Illustrate this information in a histogram.  (ii) Draw the frequency polygon on this histogram. Mass (kg) Number of members  (i) From this information prepare a table with the mid-values of the class intervals.  (ii) Draw the frequency polygon using the mid-values of the class intervals. This is a another method of representing data of a frequency distribution graphically. Let us see how to draw the cumulative frequency curve by considering the following example Example 1 The following is a frequency distribution of the marks in Mathematics of 32 students in a class. Let us draw its cumulative frequency curve. Class intervals (Marks) Frequency (Number of students) 5. The table given below is prepared from the information of a communication centre on the number of telephone calls taken on a certain day and the time duration of those calls. Time duration of one telephone call (seconds)  (i) Draw the histogram of this frequency distribution.  (ii) Use this histogram to draw the frequency polygon. 15.3 Cumulative frequency curve of a grouped frequency  distribution  frequency 4 10 20 29 32 0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 The word "cumulative" means "increasing by addition". For example, in the above table, the cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 20-30 is the sum of all frequencies less than in the intervals up to the class mark 30. (In other words no. of students whose marks are less than 30) That is equal to 20. The cumulative frequency relevant to the class interval 40 - 50 is the number of students whose marks are less than 50. That is 32, the total number of students. After completing this table, to draw the cumulative frequency curve, all the points corresponding to the upper limit of each class interval via the relevant cumulative frequency should be marked. These points should be joined smoothly, as shown below. 40 Upper limit of class intervals In previous sections, we learnt how to construct a histogram, frequency polygon and cumulative frequency curve from a group of data. These are useful to get an idea about how far the data disperses centrally. For example, just by looking at the histogram, the modal class of a grouped frequency distribution can be decided. Similarly, an idea on how far the data disperses symmetrically can also be obtained. In this section, we hope to learn about quartiles and the interquartile range of a group of data. From this we can get some idea about the dispersion of data. 112 The first thing to do to find quartiles and the interquartile range is to organize the data in ascending order. After that the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2) and the third quartile (Q3) can be found as follows. Find the median of the data to the left of the second quartile. This is the first quartile. Find the median of the data to the right of the second quartile. This is the third quartile. The median of that part is 11. That is also in the square. At last, consider the data right of the median. ' The median of that part is 20. That is also in a square. Hence, first quartile = Q1 = 11 second quartile = Q2= 14 third quartile = Q3= 20.  8 + 11 2 The median of that is 6. It is in the square. Hence Q1= 6. The median of that is 15. It is in the square. Hence Q3= 15.  There are 16 data in the following data string. Observe how to calculate the quartiles which are indicated by the heads of arrows.  25 + 26 2  30 + 30 2  35 + 37 2 In statistics, there are several methods to find quartiles of a data string. The method described here is the most practical and the most convenient method. Another method to calculate quartiles is, finding the locations of the quartiles using the formulae  1 4  2 4  3 4 Q3 is located at the place As another example, consider the data string 9 12 18 20 21 23 24 26. In this data string, according to the formulae,  105 + 107  105 + 107 2 2 = = 106 106  115 + 119 2 115 + 119  2 = = 117 117           1 4  2 4  3 4  = 2. 25. Hence Q1 = 12 + 1 4  = 4.5. Hence Q2 = 20 + 21  = 6.75. Hence Q3 = 23 + 3 4 Here, when using different methods from each other, different answers with small deviations may be obtained. But this is not a problem since in methods of statistics it is expected to get approximate values. The interquartile range of a group of data is the value obtained by subtracting the first quartile from the third quartile.  (i) Median  (ii) First quartile (iii) Third quartile (iv) Interquartile range.  (i) Median  (ii) First quartile (iii) Third quartile (iv) Interquartile range.                       In this section, we hope to learn how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped data. Here we describe only, how to find it using the cumulative frequency curve. Let us consider how to find quartiles and the interquartile range of grouped data from the following example. The following is a frequency distribution prepared from the Mathematics marks of a group of students in grade 11. Let us draw the cumulative frequency curve for this frequency distribution. 16 24 34 43 48 52  0 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 30 - 40 40 - 50 50 - 60 60 - 70 70 - 80  (i) Median  (ii) First quartile (iii) Third quartile (iv) Interquartile range.         40 (0, 39) 35 30 (0, 26) 25 15 (0, 13) 10 30 20 (26, 0) 50 60 40 (42, 0) (55, 0) Now let us pay attention to the vertical lines and the horizontal lines in the above figure of the cumulative frequency curve. Here the total number of data is 52. That is, the sum of the frequencies is 52. Let us first find, the locations of the first, second and third quartiles of those 52 data. Note: When finding the quartiles from the cumulative frequency curve, there is no need to do it as in setion 15.5. Since the number of data is large (More than 30 data values is considered as a large number of data), it is sufficient to locate the positions of 1  of the frequencies. 4  of the frequencies and 3 4  of the frequencies, 1 2 When the cumulative frequency is increasing then the first quartile is located at the position of 1 4  1 4  1 2  3 4 Now it is needed to find the data corresponding to the points 13, 26 and 39 (frequencies) > > > > > > of the vertical axis. The necessary lines are illustrated in the figure. As an example the first quartile can be found as follows. Since the first quartile is located at the 13th position, a horizontal line is drawn from the point 13 on the vertical axis until it meets the curve. From the point that line meets the curve, a vertical line is drawn until it meets the horizontal axis. The value of that point on the horizontal axis is the first quartile. If we find the quartiles for the given example, then we get Q1 = 26, Q2 = 42 and Q3 = 55' Hence, the interquartile range = Q3 – Q1 = 55 – 26 = 29. As an example, if the total frequency of a frequency distribution is 51 then the first, the second and the third quartiles are in the  1 4  1 2  3 4 Hence the quartiles can be found by considering the values on the x-axis corresponding to the values 12.75, 25.5 and 38.25 (or the appropriate values rounded to the scale of the graph) on the vertical axis.

Given below is an arithmetic progression. In this sequence, by adding the constant value 2 to any term, the term next to it is obtained. We called this constant value the common difference of the arithmetic progression. In this sequence, the first term is 3. The second term is obtained by multiplying the first term by 2, third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 2. The sequence continues in this manner, where, each term multiplied by 2 is the next term. In other words, if we divide any term other than the first term, by the previous term we get the constant value 2. A sequence that yields a fixed value when any term, other than the first term, is divided by the previous term is called a geometric progression. The fixed value, by which each term is multiplied to obtain the next term, is called the common ratio of the geometric progression. The common ratio of the above geometric progression is 2. Given a number sequence, one can check whether it is a geometric progression by doing the following test. Note down the value obtained by dividing the second term by the first term. Similarly, note down the values obtained by dividing the third term by the second term, fourth term by the third term and so forth. If the values noted down are all equal, then it is a geometric progression. When the noted values are all equal, this common value is the common ratio. 122  ² identify whether a given number sequence is a geometric progression,  ² use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression,  ² use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression     6 2 18 6 54 18 54 18  = 18 6  ...  ... The given sequence is a geometric progression. Moreover, the common ratio is 3. 20 50  50 100  100 200 Check whether the number sequence 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80, ... is a geometric progression. The terms 4, x, 16 are consecutive terms of a geometric progression. What is the value of x?  = 16 x x by solving this equation.  –10  5  ... –10  5  
 = 20 –10  20 –10  = – 40 20 – 40 20  80 – 40  80 – 40 = – 2   Let us check for each of the values we have obtained, whether the three terms 4, x, 16 are in a geometric progression. hen x = 8" the sequence 4, 8, 16 is a geometric progression with common ratio 2. When x = – 8" the sequence 4, – 8, 16 is a geometric progression with a common ratio – 2. Recall that you learnt, in Grade 10, that the nth term of an arithmetic progression with first term a and common difference d is Tn = a + (n – 1) d. Let us now consider how we can obtain an expression for the nth term of a geometric progression. We will write —a˜ for the first term of the geometric progression and —r˜ for the common ratio. Moreover, we will denote the nth term of the sequence by Tn . Consider the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, 54, ... . Here, the first term (a) is 2 and the common ratio (r) is 3' T1 = 2 = 2 1 = 2 31 – 1 T2 = 6 = 2 3 = 2 32 – 1 T3 = 18 = 2 3 3 = 2 33 – 1 T4 = 54 = 2 3 3 3 = 2 34 – 1 The above expressions can be written in terms of the first term (a) and the common ratio (r), as If x  = 16 x 4 Thus ... (x – 8) (x + 8) = 0 ... x = 8 or x = – 8     T1 = 2 30 = a r1 – 1 T2 = 2 31 = a r2 – 1 T3 = 2 32 = a r3 – 1 T4 = 2 33 = a r4 – 1 According to the observable pattern, the nth term Tn can be written as Tn = ar n – 1' The nth term of the geometric progression with first term a and common ratio r is given by Find the 5th term of the geometric progression with first term 3 and common ratio 2.  a = 3, r = 2, n = 5 Tn = ar n – 1 T5 = 3 25 – 1  = 3 24  = 3 16  = 48 Therefore, the 5th term is 48'      T7 = 81 1 3  = 81 1 3  = 81 1 729  
 
 
a = 81 27 81  Tn = ar n – 1  ... T5 = 81 1 3  = 81 1 3  1 81 Thus, the fifth term is 1 and the seventh term is 1 9 = 81 = 1

T4 = a (3)4 – 1  ... 54  = a (3)3  ... 54 = a 27 54  ... a = 27  = 2 The first term of the sequence is 2'           
 
 
 
Find the common ratio of the geometric progression with first term 5 and 7th term 320, and list the first five terms. There are two values for the common ratio. Hence, there are two geometric progressions satisfying the given conditions.  First five terms of the progression with r  First five terms of the progression with r  = 2 are 5, 10, 20, 40, 80'  = – 2 are 5, – 10, 20, – 40, 80' Which term is ratio 1 ? 4  ... 320  ... r 6  Tn = ar (n – 1) T7 = 5 (r)7 – 1  = 5 (r)6 320  =  5  = 64  = (+2)6 or (–2)6  = 2 or – 2   
 
 1 4  = 1  1 46 4  = 1  1 4 4  (n – 1) = 6  n = 6 + 1  = 7 ... it is the 7th term that is equal to 64 64 4 = 64 1 4 1            The first term of a geometric progression, is 160 and the 6th term is 1215. Find the common ratio of the progression. Similarly, when any two terms of a geometric progression are given, Tn = ar n – 1 can be used to find the first term and the common ratio. Consider the following example. Find the common ratio and the first term of the geometric progression with 3rd term 48 and 6th term 3072. Tn = ar n – 1 T3 = ar (3 – 1)  = 48  ar 2  T6 = ar (6 – 1)  ar 5  = 3072 35 25  = 3 2  = 1 ... The common ratio is 1   160r 5  ... r 5 1215 = 160 (r)6 – 1  = 1215 1215 160 243 32  
           Both unknowns, a and r, appear in both equations 1 and 2. We can easily remove a from these two by dividing the equations. 3072 48 ar 5 ar 2 =  r 3  = 64  r 3  = 43  r = 4

Exercise 16.3 1. Find the first term of the geometric progression with common ratio 3 and 4th term 6. The common ratio of a geometric progression is 2 and the first term is 1 32 7. Which term is equal to 35 9 common ratio 2 3        The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression with first term a and common ratio r is denoted by Sn' Let us now consider finding a formula for Sn ' T1 = a, T2 = ar, T3 = ar2, T4 = ar3, ...., Tn = ar (n – 1). Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + ...... + Tn ... Sn = a + ar + ar2 +ar3 + ............ + ar (n – 1)   We use the following technique to find a formula for Sn. First we will multiply both sides of equation 1 by r. Then we get, Now, when we subtract 1 from 2 , we get" r Sn – Sn = arn – a ^observe that many terms on the right hand side cancel& ... Sn (r –1) = a (rn –1) a (rn –1)  ... Sn = (r –1) This is an expression for Sn in terms of a, r, n. By multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the right hand side by – 1, we can also express it as a (1– rn) (1– r) 12. The 4th term of a geometric progression is 100 and the 9th term is 31 8    a (r n –1) (r –1) a (1– r n ) (1– r) Find the sum of the first five terms of the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, ..., both by finding the first five terms and adding them up, and by using the formula for Sn . Let us first find the sum by adding all five terms. We are given that T1 = 2, T2 = 6 and T3 = 18 Moreover, T4 = 18 3 = 54 and T5 = 54 3 = 162 . Therefore" S5 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5 = 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + 162 = 242 a (rn –1) (r –1)  = 3, n = 5. Now let us use Sn = Because a = 2, r = 6 2 a (rn – 1) r – 1 2 (35 – 1) 3 – 1 2 242  2  = 242 Sum of the first five terms is 242' When the values of the terms are large or when there are many terms to add, it is easier to to use the formula for Sn.       Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric progression 120, – 60, 30, .... using the formula. a = 120, r = – 60 120  = – 1 2 a (1 – rn) 1 – r 120 1 – 1 2 1 – 1 – 2 120 1 – 1 64  3 2  .. 3  = 120 63 64 2  
 = 120 63 64  2 3 = 315 4 = 78 3 4 Therefore, the sum of the first six terms is 78 3 4 . These are a, r, n and Sn' There are four unknowns in the formula Sn = When any three of these are given, we can find the value of the remaining unknown 1 – r a (1 – rn) Find how many terms of the initial terms need to be added from the geometric progression 5, 15, 45, ... in order for the sum to be equal to 1820. 5 = 3, Sn = 1820  a (rn –1) r –1    5 (3n – 1) 3 – 1 5 (3n – 1)  1820 =  2 1820 = 5 (3n – 1)  728 = 3n – 1  1 + 728 = 3n  729 = 3n  36 = 3n  n = 6  1. Find the sum of the first 5 terms of the geometric progression with first term 4 and common ratio 3, both by writing the first 5 terms and adding them up and also using the formula. and common ratio 1 3 is 26 26 27  In this section we will discuss various types of problems related to geometric progressions, that we have not discussed above. Of a geometric progression, the sum of the first and second terms is equal to 9 and the sum of the 4th and 5th terms is equal to – 72. Find the first 5 terms of the progression. T1 = a, T2 = ar  a + ar = 9  a (1 + r) = 9 T4 = ar3, T5 = ar4  ar3 + ar4 = – 72  ar3 (1 + r) = – 72 ar 3(1 + r) – 72 = a (1 + r)  9  r 3  = – 8  r 3  = (– 2)3  r = – 2
