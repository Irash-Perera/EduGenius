• find the perimeter of a sector of a circle and • solve problems related to the perimeter of plane figures containing sectors In previous grades you have learnt how to find the perimeter of plane figures such as a rectangle, a square, a triangle and a circle. Facts relating to these can be summarized as follows.       While doing the above exercise you would have recalled facts on finding the perimeter of some basic plane figures as well as of compound figures. Now let us consider the perimeter of sectors of circles. The region which is shaded in this figure is a portion of a circle with centre C which is bounded by two radii and a part of the circumference. Such a portion is called a  which is the angle sector of a circle. The angle θ between the two radii is called the angle at the centre. 1. Find the perimeter of each of the following plane figures. (i)            The figure illustrates a sector of a circle of radius r. Such a sector is called a sector of radius r and angle at the centre θ. Let us now consider how the arc length of such a sector of a circle is found. Let us first find the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r. We know that the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2πr. he angle at the centre of the circle is 360o. The arc length corresponding to this angle is the circumference of the circle which is 2πr. Here, the reason for taking the arc length of the semi-circle to be πr, that is, the value of 2πr divided by 2, is the symmetry of the circle. The expression πr for the arc length of a semi-circle of radius r can be obtained by reasoning out in the following manner too. Let us consider a circle and a semi-circle, both of radius r. 360o. Therefore, the arc length of the semi-circle should be of the arc length of the circle.        In the same manner, since the angle at the centre is 90o for a sector which is the circle, Reasoning out in this manner, an expression can easily be obtained for the arc length of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θ x. The circumference of the circle = 2πr Arc length =         Study the following table to understand further about finding the arc length of a sector of a circle. the fraction of arc Length as a the circumference (According to the figure) Angle at the centre Angle at the centre as a fraction of the total angle at the centre Observe the 1st and 2nd columns of the table. If the length of the arc of the circle can be identified from the figure as a fraction of the circumference, then the length of the arc can easily be found. When the angle at the centre is in degrees, this fraction is  angle at the centre 360                  Accordingly, it should be clearer to you now that the length of an arc with angle at the centre θx and radius r is Now let us consider several examples. In the following examples and exercises it is assumed that the value of π is 22 7 (i) What fraction of the circumference of the circle in the figure is the arc length of the shaded sector? Let the radius be r cm.  Arc length                 Example 3 The arc length of the sector in the figure is 11 cm. Find the angle at the centre of this sector. Let θ o be the angle at the centre.  Then,  arc length cm 9  2 1              To obtain the perimeter of a sector of a circle, the arc length and the lengths of the two radii by which the sector is bounded should be added together. The figure denotes a sector of a circle of radius 21 cm with angle at the centre 120o. Find its perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of a sector of a circle of radius r with angle at the centre θ  The perimeter of the sector = 44 + 2 « 21  = 86 cm Example 2 The perimeter of a sector which is  2 1                      2 1 c 60x  (i) when the angle at the centre is 180x and the perimeter is 180 cm. (ii) when the angle at the centre is 120x and the perimeter is 43 cm.  (i) when the perimeter is 64 cm and radius is 21 cm. (ii) when the perimeter is 53 cm and the radius is 21 cm.                    Let us see how the perimeter of plane figures containing sectors of circles is found by considering several examples.  The figure illustrates how a semi-circle has been joined to a rectangle of length 20 cm and breadth 14 cm such that the breadth of the rectangle is the diameter of the semi-circle. Find the perimeter of this figure. The figure represents a square lamina of side length 15 cm. If the shaded sector (AGB) and the triangular portion (GEF) are cut out, find the perimeter of the portion (BCDFG) that is left over. Perimeter of BCDFG is BC + CD + DF + FG + arc length GB First let us find the length of FG. Let us apply PythagorasZ theorem to the right angled triangle GEF.                      Next let us find the arc length GB. Since the angle at the centre of the sector ABG is 90o,  BC = 15 − 7 cm  = 8 cm  DF = 15 − 6 cm  = 9 cm    = 8 + 15 + 9 + 10 + 11  = 53 cm 7 cm O 2. A semi-circular portion of diameter 7 cm has been cut out from a semi-circular lamina of radius 7 cm and welded to the lamina again as shown in the figure.  (ii) Find the arc length of the sector of the circle of diameter 7 cm (iii) Find the perimeter of the shaded region.  cm 4                                  3. The figure illustrates how an equilateral triangle of side length 7 cm is drawn within a sector of a circle of radius the length of a side of the triangle. (i) Find the arc length of the sector of the circle. (ii) Find the perimeter of the shaded region.   4. The figure shows two sectors of circles ABED and CDFB. If AB = 10.5 cm, find the perimeter of the shaded region using the given data. 5. The figure shows two sectors of circles of centre A and radius AD and AR respectively. How much greater is the perimeter of the sector APQR than the perimeter of the shaded region? 45x 3'5 cm      1. A sector of a circle as shown in the figure, with angle at the centre equal to 120o has been cut out from a circular lamina of radius 21 cm. Show that the perimeter of the remaining portion of the lamina is 130 cm.                    2. The figure depicts a pond having semi-circular boundaries. A protective fence along the boundary of the pond has been planned.  (ii) It has been estimated that the cost of constructing 1 m of the fence is Rs. 5000. How much will it cost to complete the whole fence? 4. A portion of a grill to be fixed to a window has been made by combining two equal sectors of circles as shown in the figure. The person making the grill states that based on the given data, a wire of length 128 cm is required for it. Show with reasons that his statement is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You have earlier learnt some facts about the square of a number, and the square root of a positive number. Let us briefly recall what you have learnt. The value of 3 « 3 is 9. We denote 3 « 3 in short by 32. This is read as ‘three squared’. The ‘2’ in 32 denotes the fact that two threes are multiplied ‘twice’ over. Accordingly, three squared is 9 and this can be written as 32 = 9. 1 2 3 4 5  1 × 1  2 × 2  3 × 3  4 × 4  5 × 5 How the square of the number is denoted  12 22 32 42 52 Square of the number 1 4 9 16 25 Numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares. Finding the square root is the inverse of squaring. For example, since 32 = 9, we say that the square root of 9 is 3. It will be clear to you, according to the first and last columns of the above table that  the square root of 1 is 1,  the square root of 4 is 2,  the square root of 9 is 3,  the square root of 16 is 4  and the square root of 25 is 5.   By studying this lesson you will be able to • approximate the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect square • use the division method to find an approximate value for the square root of a  It is clear that every number has a square. However, does every positive number have a square root? Let us investigate this. According to the above table, the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 9 is 3. The square root of a number between 4 and 9 is a value between 2 and 3. Accordingly, it is clear that the square root of a number between 4 and 9 is not an integer. It is a decimal number. In this lesson we will consider how an approximate value is found for this. We call such a value an approximation. Let us for example consider how an approximate value is obtained for the square root of 5. Consider the following table. Number How the square of the number is found How the square of the number is written The square of the number 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2 × 2 2.1 × 2.1 2.2 × 2.2 2.3 × 2.3 2.4 × 2.4 2.5 × 2.5 2.6 × 2.6 2.7 × 2.7 22 2.12 2.22 2.32 2.42 2.52 2.62 2.72 4 4.41 4.84 5.29 5.76 6.25 6.76 7.29 From the values in the right hand side column, the two values that are closest to 5 are 4.84 and 5.29. They are the squares of 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. According to the above table, the square roots of 4.84 and 5.29 are respectively 2.2 and 2.3. This can be written symbolically as Now let us examine which value from 4.84 and 5.29 is closer to 5. The difference between 4.84 and 5 = 5 – 4.84 = 0.16 The difference between 5.29 and 5 = 5.29 – 5 = 0.29 Accordingly, the value that is closer to 5 is 4.84. Therefore, 2.2 can be taken as an approximate value for the square root of 5. The value that is obtained for the square root of a positive integer which is correct to the first decimal place is called the “approximation to the first decimal place” of the square root of the given number (or more simply the “first approximation”) Accordingly, the approximation of square root of 5 to the first decimal place is 2.2. When an approximate value is given, the symbol is used. Accordingly, we can write By providing reasons in a similar manner, we can conclude that the approximation of square root of 6 to the first decimal place is 2.4 and the approximation of square root of 7 to the first decimal place is 2.6 That is, By considering the following examples let us now learn a specific method of finding the first approximation of the square root of a positive number which is not a perfect square. Approximate • From the perfect square numbers which are less than 17, the one which is closest to it is 16, and from the perfect square numbers which are greater than 17, the one which is closest to it is 25.  Accordingly, let us write 16 < 17 < 25 	 	
	
Accordingly, the square root of 17 is greater than 4 which is the square root of 16, and less than 5 which is the square root of 25. • To find an approximate value close to 16 or to 25. The difference between 16 and 17 is 1. The difference between 17 and 25 is 8.      Since the value of 4.22 exceeds 17, it is unnecessary to find 4.32 and 4.42. 16.81 is the closer value to 17 from these two. Find the first approximation of Since 152 = 225 and 162 = 256, ince 245 is closer to 256 than to 225,  The first approximation of Let us now determine this value. 15'9 x 15'9 = 252'81 15'8 x 15'8 = 249'64 15'7 x 15'7 = 246'49 15'6 x 15'6 = 243'36 From the above values, 246.49 is closest to 245. Exercise 2.1 Find the first approximation of each of the following numbers.         Let us now consider a method of finding the square root of any positive number. This method is called the division method. Let us study this method by considering several examples. Step 1 Separate 1764 as shown below, by grouping the digits of 1764 in pairs, starting from the units position and proceeding towards the left. 17 64 Find the perfect square number which is closest to the leftmost digit or pair of digits of the separated number, and as indicated below, write its square root above and to the left of the drawn lines. Step 3 Write down the product 4 x 4 of the number above and to the left of the lines, below the number 17 as indicated, and subtract it from 17. Next, write on the left as shown below, the digit 8, which is two times the number above the line, leaving space for another number to be written. (i.e., leave space for Step 4 Now carry down the next two digits 64, as indicated below.       The same digit should be written above the line to the right of 4 and in the space left in the units position on the left. This digit should be selected so that the product of this digit and the number obtained on the left when this digit is written in the units position (in this case 82), is equal to 164, or is the closest number less than 164 that can be obtained in this manner. When finding the square root of a decimal number, separate the digits in pairs on both sides of the decimal point, starting at the decimal point as shown below.  3'61  12'321 143'456 3' 61 12' 32 10 1 43' 45 60      We must find the value to three decimal places and round off to two decimal places. To find to three decimal places we must write three pairs of zeros after the decimal point. 5 2 ' 6 3 1 27 37' 00 00 00 25 2 37 2 04 33 00 31 29  1 71 00  1 04 61  66 39 00  62 77 56  3 61 44 As above let us find the value to three decimal places and round off to two decimal places. For this there must be three pairs of decimal places after the decimal point.        Exercise 2.2 1. Find the square root of each of the following numbers.  Area of the square  Length of a side of the square =  Area of the square = 441 cm2  Length of a side of the square =  
     
 
324 square shaped garden tiles of area 900 cm2 each have been placed in a square shaped courtyard so that the courtyard is completely covered with the tiles. Find the length of a side of the courtyard.                          Exercise 2.3 1. What is the length of a side of a square shaped piece of cardboard of area 3. 196 children participating in a drill display have been placed such that they form an equal number of rows and columns. How many children are there in a row? 5. A rectangular walkway has been made by placing 10 flat square shaped concrete slabs along 200 rows. If the area of the flat surface of a concrete slab is 231.04 cm2, what is the length and the breadth of the walkway? Miscellaneous Exercise 1. Find the value accurate to the second decimal place. 2. The length and breadth of a rectangular shaped plot of land are respectively 25 m and 12 m. Find to the nearest metre, the least distance that a child standing at one corner of the plot should travel to reach the diagonally opposite corner of the plot. 3. If the length of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right angled triangle is 12 cm, find the length of a remaining side. (Give the answer to two decimal places).  The figure depicts a slab of a certain type of chocolate. It has been divided into ten equal sized pieces such that the pieces can easily be broken off. When the whole slab of chocolate is considered as one unit, ● one piece of chocolate that is broken off is considered as of fractions. Now let us consider another example. The above figure depicts how pieces of cheese have been arranged in a container. There are 8 equal pieces. One of the pieces has been removed from the container. This piece is of the amount of cheese in the container. If the total mass of all the pieces of cheese in the container is 160 g, then the piece that was removed which is • identify situations in which fractions are applied • solve problems involving fractions.      For example, in the statement “ of all the students in the class are girls”, the  is applied by taking “the total number of students in the class” as the fraction unit. In the following table, the units relevant to several statements involving fractions The volume of atmosphere The piece of wire of length 5 m The circular shape illustrated in the following figure has been divided into 6 equal parts. We know that the fraction that has been shaded is of the shape.                                                                   is 6 and the numerator is 2. The total number of parts into which the unit has been divided is the denominator, and the number of parts being Such fractions are called proper fractions. Fractions such as numerator equal to 1 are called unit fractions. Further, considering fractions such as and the denominators are not, as the denominator increases, the value represented by the fraction decreases. That is, According to the figure, the quantities represented by the three fractions are equal. That is, Such fractions which are equal to each other are called equivalent fractions. Observe that fractions which are equivalent to a given fraction are obtained when     both the numerator and the denominator are multiplied by the same number. For example, Equivalent fractions are also obtained when the numerator and the denominator of the given fraction are divided by the same number. For example, It can be observed that among the fractions which are equivalent to there are some which have the same denominator.  are two more such fractions. For convenience, let us select denominator. Let us explain the comparison of using figures.    Accordingly, it is clear that it is suitable to write equivalent fractions having a common denominator when comparing fractions. Now let us consider the addition and subtraction of fractions. You have learnt in earlier grades to add fractions with equal denominators, as for example Similarly, you know that fractions with equal denominators can be subtracted as for example, When adding and subtracting fractions of unequal denominators, the relevant fractions can first be converted into equivalent fractions of equal denominators. For example, that is obtained when a loaf of bread is divided into two equal parts and three such parts are considered. This quantity is one and a half loaves of bread. That is, loaves of bread, which in short, is a quantity of                  You have learnt in previous grades how a mixed number is converted into an improper fraction and how an improper fraction is converted into a mixed number. It is clear that ‘of’ in and that the numerator can be taken as 1 « 3 and the denominator as 2 « 4'             Let us find how many the following figure that this value is 2. However, since half of any quantity, is the amount that is obtained when the quantity is divided by 2, t is not convenient to draw figures every time we divide fractions. We need to identify a different method to do this. The above division of fractions which was done using figures, can also be presented in the following manner.            Do the following exercise to further recall the facts that have been learnt about fractions. That is, the same answer that was obtained with the figures is obtained using this method too. The order in which the mathematical operations are manipulated when simplifying fractions, is as follows: In general, when a fraction needs to be divided by another fraction, the first fraction can be multiplied by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Let us recall all the facts that have been learnt so far regarding fractions by working out the following example. B – Brackets O – Of D – Division M – Multiplication A – Addition S – Subtraction          Unit Fractions Proper Fractions Improper Fractions Mixed number Improper fraction  of a tank which was completely filled with water was used by a household for its needs on a certain day, what fraction of the tank still held water by the end       7. If the two shaded regions of the circular lamina that has been divided into eight equal parts as shown in the figure, are cut out and discarded,  (i) what fraction of the total lamina is remaining?  (ii) what fraction of the total lamina is exactly half the remaining                                                         Fractions are used in many calculations that come up in day to day life. These calculations can easily be carried out with a correct understanding of fractions. Given below are several examples of such situations. Example 1  of a mixture of flour prepared to make a certain type of food consists of kurakkan flour, while the remaining portion consists of wheat flour. A cook wishes to prepare  Quantity of kurakkan flour in the mixture = 20 kg  The quantity of wheat flour in the mixture = 50 – 20 kg Example 2 It takes 12 minutes to fill  of a certain tank using a pipe through which water flows at a uniform rate.

Do the following exercise to recall the facts you have learnt earlier about simplifying algebraic expressions. What you simplified in 3(b) above is the product of two binomial expressions of the form x + a.

(All the measurements below are assumed to have been given in the same units). A  length of AB = 3x + 2  length of AD = 2x + 3 According to the figure, Area of the rectangle ABCD = The sum of the areas of the four smaller rectangles = 6x2 + 9x + 4x + 6 = 6x2 + 13x + 6 It is clear according to (1) and (2) that, (3x + 2) (2x + 3) = 6x2 + 13x + 6 Now study how the binomial expressions of different types given in the following examples have been expanded and simplified.  (2x + y) (x + 3y) = 2x (x + 3y) + y (x + 3y) = 2x2 + 6xy + xy + 3y2 = 2x2 + 7xy + 3y2                             a. (x + 2) (x + 2) b. (x – 3) (x – 3)  d. (2p – 5) (p – 3) e. (3x – 1) (3x + 1)  g.

A child bought a mandarins which were priced at x rupees each. He then decides to buy three times that number of apples. The price of an apple is twice the price of a mandarin. (i) Write an expression in terms of a and x for the cost of the apples.  The fruit seller states that if the number of apples that are bought is increased by 5 fruits, he can reduce the price of each apple that is bought by 3 rupees. Accordingly, the child decides to buy 5 more apples. 3. Piyumi made a square - shaped flower bed. Her sister made a rectangular flower  bed. The length of the sister's bed was 3 metres more than of Piyumi's and the  width was 2 metres less than of Piyumi's. Taking the length of one side of  Piyumi's bed as x, write the length and width of the sister's bed in terms of x and  then express its area in the form Ax2 + Bx + C.      Let us turn our attention again to the following expressions which you expanded in the above exercise. Do you notice that the two binomial expressions to be multiplied are equal? (x – 3) (x – 3) = (x – 3)2 (5x – 2y) (5x – 2y) = (5x – 2y)2 Each of these expressions written in the form (x + 2)2, (x – 3)2 and (5x – 2y)2 is called the square of the respective binomial expression. The same method that was used above to simplify the product of two binomial expressions can be used to expand such squares of binomial expressions too. Simplifying the square of a binomial expression can be done using another method too. Now let us consider how the squares of binomial expressions of the form (a + b) and (a – b) are expanded. (iii) Write down the price of an apple in terms of x. (iv) Write down the cost of the apples in terms of a and x. (v) Expand and simplify the binomial expression in (iv) above.               Two times the product of the first and second terms Now let us consider the expansion of (a − b)2  Note : The expansion of (a − b)2 can also be obtained by substituting − b for b in the expansion of (a + b)2 i.e., (a + (− b))2 = a2 + 2(a) (− b) + (− b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2 Also, You may have observed that the expansions of (a + b)2 and (–a – b)2 are equal to each other and that the expansions of (a – b)2 and (–a + b)2 too are equal to each other.

Such figures are called rectilinear plane figures. The sides and the angles are called the elements (parts) of these figures. The pairs of rectilinear plane figures presented below in figures (i) to (iv), which are identical in shape and size can be placed on each other such that they coincide. A pair of plane figures which may be made to coincide is called a pair of congruent plane figures. In this section we concentrate on the congruence of pairs of triangles. A triangle has six elements. They are the three sides and the three angles of the triangle. Let us assume that the two triangles ABC and PQR given below are congruent. Let us also assume that, when the two triangles are placed one on top of the other By studying this lesson you will be able to  • recognize the congruence of two plane figures  • identify the necessary conditions for two triangles to be congruent  • prove riders by using the congruence of triangles such that they coincide, then AB coincides with PQ, AC coincides with PR and BC coincides with QR. Then we say that, in the two triangles, the side corresponding to AB is PQ, the side corresponding to AC is PR and the side corresponding to BC , the angle is QR. Similarly, we say that the angle corresponding to . corresponding to  and the angle corresponding to A Q ZZ' For We indicate the fact that two triangles are congruent by using the symbol zz example, if the two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent, we indicate this fact by writing  It is not necessary to show that the six elements of one triangle are equal to the six elements of the other triangle as indicated above to show that a pair of triangles is congruent. It is sufficient to show that three of the elements are equal. However, this does not mean that if any three elements of one triangle are equal to three elements of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. In certain cases, when three elements of one triangle are equal to three elements of another triangle, then the remaining elements too are equal and the triangles are congruent. There are four such cases. Let us now consider these four cases. The case in which two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle Three triangles with two sides of length 2'5 cm and 3'5 cm and an angle of magnitude 30o are given below. A 2 ' 5  cm 2 ' 5  2 ' 5     This result which you discovered through the above activity has been used as an axiom of geometry from ancient times. If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent in the above manner is mentioned in short as being congruent under the case SAS. It must be clear to you through the above activity, that only the triangle PQR is congruent to the triangle ABC. Both the triangles PQR and LMN have three elements which are equal to the given three elements of the triangle ABC. However, the triangle ABC is only congruent to the triangle PQR. It should be clear to you from this that, just because two triangles have three elements which are equal to each other, it does not mean that the triangles are congruent. Let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR but not to the triangle LMN. The 30o angle of the triangle ABC is the included angle of the sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm. It is the same for the triangle PQR. However the 30o angle is not the included angle of the sides of length 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm of the triangle LMN. Two sides and the included angle of triangle ABC are equal to two sides and the included angle of triangle PQR. But this cannot be said about the triangles ABC and LMN. There is insufficient data to state that and ABC and  Note: Here the angle ACB AC and CB. Similarly, the angle RPQ of the triangle PQR.                   That is, the sides AB and QR which are opposite the equal angles ACB to each other, the angles ABC PQ are equal to each other, and the angles CAB equal to each other. Now let us consider an example. According to the data marked on the figure, prove that the triangles ABC and ADC are congruent, and write all the remaining equal corresponding elements.  1. Determine for which pairs of triangles the SAS case can be applied to prove congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.                   2. For each of the following parts, draw a sketch of the relevant pairs of triangles based on the information that is given. From these pairs of triangles, select the ones which are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.  (i) In the triangles PQR and XYZ, (ii) In the triangles ABC and LMN, (iii) In the triangles DEF and STU, (iv) In the triangles ABC and PQR, Prove that,  (i)  (ii) AC = BD. In the quadrilateral ABCD, the sides AD and BC are parallel and equal in length. Mark the given data in the diagram and prove that, (i) (ii) AB = DC, (iii) AB and DC are parallel to each other.                            (i) (ii) the lines AD and BC are parallel to each other.  Now let us consider the second case by which the congruence of two triangles can be identified. (b) Second Case The case in which the magnitudes of two angles and the length of a side of a triangle are equal to the magnitudes of two angles and the length of a corresponding side of another triangle ² Copy the triangle ABC onto a tissue paper and cut it out. ² Place it on the triangles PQR and LMN and examine which triangle it coincides It must be clear to you according to this activity that the trianlge ABC is congruent only to the triangle PQR. In this case too, as in the case (a), the two triangles PQR and LMN have three elements which are equal to three elements of the triangle ABC. However, although the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR, it is not congruent to the triangle LMN. As before, it should be clear to you from this that, just because two triangles have three elements which are equal to each other, it does not mean that the triangles are congruent. Consider the triangles given below. P Using the information marked on the triangle ABC, prove that,  (i) (ii)       Therefore, let us consider another method by which we can identify that the triangle ABC is congruent to the triangle PQR. The given side of length 2.5 cm is opposite the given 30o angle of the triangle ABC. It is the same for the triangle PQR. However it is not the same in the triangle LMN. Accordingly, two angles of triangle ABC is equal to two angles of triangle PQR, and one side of triangle ABC is equal to the corresponding side of triangle PQR. However, the corresponding side of triangle LMN is not equal to that of triangle ABC. Note: Here, corresponding sides are defined as those which are opposite equal angles of the two triangles. Using the given data, we can show as done below, that the triangles STU and LMN in the following figure are congruent according to the case mentioned above. (Given) (Given) Note: In the above two triangles ST and MN are a pair of corresponding sides which are also equal. Observe carefully that they are corresponding sides because they are opposite the angles SUT Example 1 Based on the data marked on the figure, prove that, remaining equal corresponding elements.   (Given) (Given) is a common side (AAS) If two angles and a side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely as being congruent according to the AAS case.                    Two angles of the triangle ABC are equal to two angles of the triangle PQR. Also, AB = PQ. However, they are not corresponding sides. The reason for this is that the angles ACB  which are opposite these two sides are not equal to each other. ^ & Therefore, there are insufficient 6 5 reasons to say that the two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent to each other by the case AAS. Mention for which pairs of triangles the AAS conditions can be applied to prove congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the other pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.                = C 2. For each of the following parts, draw a sketch of the relevant pair of triangles based on the information that is given. From these pairs of triangles, select the ones that are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other. i. In the triangles ABC and PQR, ii. In the triangles XYZ and LMN, iii. In the triangles STU and PQR, iv. In the triangles DEF and ABC, In the given figure, AB and CD are parallel to each other and BO = OD. Show that The pairs of sides AB and FE, and AC and DE are parallel to each other. Show that  > > > >        Let us consider the third case by which the congruence of two triangles can be identified. (c) Third Case Can a unique triangle be constructed when the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are given? To determine this, engage in the following activity. This result which you established through the above activity can also be used as an axiom. We can show in the following manner that the pair of triangles XYZ and DEF are congruent according to the above case. (Given) (Given) Break off pairs of ekel sticks of lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm respectively. Make two triangles of side lengths 5 cm, 6 cm and 7 cm with these pieces. Do you see that the two triangles have to be congruent? By changing the positions of the pieces of ekel in one triangle, can you create a triangle which is not congruent to the other triangle? It must be clear to you that this is not possible.  If the three sides of a triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely as being congruent according to the SSS case.     Example 1 Prove that  based on the information in the figure and write all the remaining equal corresponding elements. (Given) (Given) 1. Determine for which of the following pairs of the triangles the SSS conditions can be used to show congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other. X  (iii) = Q                          The case of the hypotenuse and a side of a right - angled triangle being equal to the hypotenuse and a side of another right - angled triangle. A pair of right-angled triangles drawn such that the hypotenuse is 3 cm and another side is 2.5 cm is shown below. 2. Draw a sketch of the following triangles based on the information that is given. Select the triangles (if there are any) which are congruent according to the SSS case and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.  In triangle PQR, PQ = 4 cm, QR = 6 cm, RP = 5 cm  In triangle XYZ, XY = 6 cm, YZ = 8 cm, ZX = 10 cm  In triangle LMN, LM = 5 cm, NM = 4 cm, NL = 6 cm  In triangle DEF, DE = 8 cm, EF = 10 cm, FD = 6 cm  In triangle ABC, BC = 8 cm, CA = 7 cm, AB = 9 cm  In triangle STU, ST = 9 cm, TU = 7 cm, SU = 5 cm To bisect the angle ABC , a student selects the point B as the centre and draws the arc PQ. The arc intersects AB and BC at the points P and Q respectively. Two equal arcs drawn from the points P and Q intersect at R. Prove that The opposite sides of the quadrilateral PQRS are equal in length. Prove that,  (i)  (ii) (iii) the opposite sides of the quadrilateral are parallel.  
 
        Accordingly, the congruence of a pair of right-angled triangles can be expressed in terms of the equality of two elements as follows. If the lengths of the hypotenuse and a side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the lengths of the hypotenuse and a side of another right-angled triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Showing that two triangles are congruent under these conditions is stated concisely as being congruent according to the RHS (right-angle-hypotenuse-side) case. Let us prove that the two triangles given below are congruent based on the information that is given. Since the above pair of triangles is congruent, the remaining pairs of corresponding elements are also equal. That is, Based on the information in the figure, prove that,  and write all the remaining equal  
corresponding elements. Proof:  In the right-angled triangles OXA and OXB, Copy the triangle in figure (i) onto a tissue paper and examine whether it can be made to coincide with the triangle in figure (ii).                    1. Determine for which of the following pairs of the triangles the RHS conditions can be used to show congruence based on the given information. For these pairs, prove that the two triangles are congruent and write down the remaining pairs of corresponding elements which are equal to each other.

Now let us consider how the area of a sector of a circle is found. The following table shows how the area of a sector is found when the angle at the centre of the sector takes certain special values.

                 Let us consider (through the following examples) how the area of a sector is found using this result. In the examples and exercises of this chapter, the value of π is taken as 22 7 If the area of the sector in the figure is circle. 1 9 According to the pattern in the table, the area of the sector of radius r and angle at the centre θx is θ 360 r x          Let us consider the areas of plane figures formed by sectors of circles and other simple plane figures such as rectangles and triangles being joined together. The following denotes a plane figure consisting of a square and a semi-circle. Find its area.      Area of the square = 14 x 14  = 196 cm2     Since the diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of a side of the square, The radius of the circle is 14 ÷ 2 = 7 cm.

A sketch of the area in front of a commemorative plaque is given in the figure. Grass has been grown in the three portions within the semi-circle which are in the shape of sectors of circles, while white sand has been spread in the other regions.  The radius of each sector within the semi-circle 60x a                                                                                                                  We know that 2x + 6 is a binomial algebraic expression. Since it can be expressed as 2(x + 3), we also know that 2 and x + 3 are its factors. Similarly, since 4x2 + 6x = 2x (2x + 3), we know that 2, x and 2x + 3 are the factors of 4x2 + 6x. Now let us find the factors of a2 – 2a + ab – 2b B. a. c. e. g. i. l. h. k. b. d. f. h.   • find the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions,  • find the factors of the difference of two squares.      2. Fill in the blanks in (i) and (ii), and factor the expressions given below them accordingly. Now let us consider factoring quadratic expressions such as x2 + 2x – 3. This expression is of the form ax2 + bx + c. Here a, b and c take integer values. We call an algebraic expression of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are non-zero, a trinomial quadratic expression in x. a is said to be the coefficient of x2, b the coefficient of x and c the constant term. It is easy to find the factors of such an expression when the terms are written in this order. The coefficient of x2 in x2 + 2x – 3 is 1 while the coefficient of x is 2 and the constant term is – 3. 4 + 2x – x2 is also a trinomial quadratic expression. To find its factors it can be written in the order – x2 + 2x + 4. When the trinomial quadratic expression x2 + 2xy – y2 is considered, it can be thought of as a quadratic expression in x or a quadratic expression in y. When it is considered as a quadratic expression in y, it is convenient to write it in the form – y2 + 2xy + x2. or example, while 3x2 − 2x − 5, a2 + 2a + 8, y2 + 2y − 5 and 5 −2x − 3x2 are trinomial quadratic expressions, the expressions a + 2x + 3 and 2x3 + 3x2 −5x are not. Let us recall how the product of two binomial expressions such as x + 2 and x + 3 is found. Since x2 + 5x + 6 is obtained as the product of x + 2 and x + 3, we obtain that x + 2 and x + 3 are factors of x2 + 5x + 6. x2 + 5x + 6 is a trinomial qudratic  (i) a (2x −y) + b (y − 2x)  = a (2x −y) − b (........)  = (........)

Let us consider the following table to do this. The two terms in the first column have been selected such that their product is 10x2.  Pair of terms  x, 10x  2x, 5x  (−x), (− 10x) (−2x) , (− 5x) Product  x x 10x = 10x2  2x x 5x = 10x2  (−x) x(− 10x) = 10x2 (−2x) x(− 5x) = 10x2 Sum  x +10x = 11 x  2x + 5x = 7 x  (−x )+ (−10x) = −11x (−2x) + (−5x ) = −7x It is clear from the above table that the middle term 7x should be written as 2x + 5x. Now, let us find the factors of the given trinomial quadratic expression. Let us see whether the factors are different if we write the middle term of x2 + 7x + 10 as the sum 5x + 2x, instead of 2x + 5x. x2 + 7x + 10 = x2 + 5x + 2x + 10 = x (x+ 5) + 2(x+ 5) = (x+ 5) (x+ 2)           expression. How do we obtain x + 2 and x + 3 as its factors? Let us examine the steps that were performed to obtain the product of the above two expressions, in the reverse order. been expressed as a sum of two terms, as 3x + 2x ² The product of the terms 3x and 2x = 3x « 2x = 6x2 ² The product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial quadratic We can come to the following conclusions based on the above observations. The middle term should be written as the sum of two terms. The product of these two terms should be equal to the product of the initial and final terms of the trinomial expression. As an example, let us factor x2 + 7x + 10 accordingly. Here, 7x is the middle term. This should be written as the sum of two terms. Also, the product of these two terms should be equal to 10x2.         We observe that the same factors are obtained. Therefore, the order in which we write the two terms that were selected has no effect on the factors. Accordingly, the factors can be found by writing 7x as either 2x + 5x or as 5x + 2x. Find the two terms which have 12a2 as their product and −8a as their sum. The following table contains pairs of terms of which the product is 12a2. The pair which when added equals – 8a has been shaded.  a + 12a = 13a  2a + 6a = 8a  3a + 4a = 7a  (−a) + (−12a) = −13a  (−2a ) + (−6a) = −8a  (−3a) + (−4a) = −7a 12a 12a 12a 12a 12a 12a Product = = = = = = ) ) ) ) That is, − 8a can be written as −2a − 6a a2 −8a + 12 = a2 −2a − 6a +12   - - - Note(- obtained as a sum mentally too. Factor x2 − 7x − 8. The product of the initial and final terms = x2 × (−8) = − 8x2 The two terms which have −8x2 as their product and −7x as their sum are + x and − 8x. Accordingly,  Now let us consider how an expression such as − x2 − x + 6 which has a negative quadratic term is factored. The factors can be found by re-writing the expression The product of the initial and final terms = a2 «12 = 12a2  The middle term = − 8a           as 6 − x − x2, with the quadratic term at the end. By considering the example given below, let us recognize the fact that the factors can be found using either form. Factor − x2 − x + 6. The product of the initial and final terms = − 6x2 The middle term = − x ' '' Example 4 Factor a2 − 4ab − 5b2. We may consider this as a trinomial quadratic expression in a. Then, the product of the initial and final terms = a2 « (−5b2) = −5a2b2 The two terms which have −5a2b2 as their product and −4ab as their sum are ab and −5ab. Note( This can also be considered as a trinomial quadratic expression in b and factored. Then too the above answer is obtained. The errors made in simplification can be minimized by examing the accuracy of the factors of a trinomial quadratic expression once they have been found. For example, let us factor x2 + 3x – 40.  x2 + 3x – 40 = x2 + 8x – 5x – 40 = x (x + 8) – 5 (x + 8) x + 8) (x – 5)             If the factors x + 8 and x – 5 are correct, by multiplying them together we should be able to get back our original expression. Let us find the product of x + 8 and x – 5 (x + 8) (x – 5) = x2 – 5x + 8x – 40  = x2 + 3x – 40  Since we have obtained our original expression x2 + 3x – 40, the factors x + 8 and x – 5 are correct.

So far we have considered only how the factors of trinomial quadratic expressions with the coefficient of x2 equal to either 1 or –1 are found. Now let us consider how the factors are found when the coefficient of x2 is some other integer. For example, let us consider the trinomial quadratic expression 3x2 + 14x + 15. This is of the form ax2 + bx + c with a = 3. In such cases too we can use the same method that we used above. Example 1 Factor 3x2 + 14x + 15.

We observe from the above expansion that the factors of x2 − y2 are x − y and x + y. Further, x2 − y2 can be considered as a quadratic expression in x and factored. By taking its middle term to be 0, we can write it in the form of a trinomial quadratic expression as x2 + 0 − y2. Let us factor this expression. Product of the initial and final terms = − x2y2  Middle term = 0 Therefore, by this too we obtain x2 – y2 = (x – y) (x + y). Let us consider the following examples of the factorization of expressions which are the difference of two squares. 7.3 The factors of expressions which are in the form of the  difference of two squares               a. e. i. b. f. j. c. g. d. h. 3.

Since BCD is a straight is an adjacent supplementary angle of line, which are the interior angles of triangle ABC apart from are called the interior opposite angles of the exterior angle . In the same manner, there are pairs of interior opposite angles corresponding to the exterior angles formed by producing the other two sides of the triangle too.  The following theorem specifies a relationship that exists between an exterior angle of a triangle and its interior opposite angles.

If two sides of a triangle are equal, then it is called an isosceles triangle. The triangle ABC in the figure given below is an isosceles triangle. In this triangle, AB = AC. The angle in front of each side of a triangle is called the angle opposite that side. The angle opposite the side AB is The angle opposite the side AC is The angle opposite the side BC is Further, A, which is the vertex at which the two equal sides meet is called the apex of the triangle. . . . According to the theorem, since AB = AC in the above isosceles triangle ABC, ' Let us engage in the following activity to verify the truth of the above Now let us consider several problems that can be solved by applying the above theorem together with theorems that have been learnt previously. ² Mark three points A, B and C (not collinear) such that AB = AC = 5cm. ² Complete the triangle ABC by joining the points A, B and C. ² Cut out the shape of the triangle ABC. ² Fold the triangular shaped piece of paper so that AB and AC coincide. ² Observe that  are equal.

In some instances, a result in geometry can be proved in several ways. Now, let us consider such a result. AB = AC in the triangle ABC. The side BA has been produced to E. The angle is bisected by AD. Prove that AD and BC are parallel to each other.  1. the perpendicular drawn from the apex to the opposite side  2. the bisector of the apex angle,  3. the straight line joining the apex to the midpoint of the opposite side and 4. the perpendicular bisector of the side opposite the apex,  coincide with each other.      To prove that AD // BC, let us show that either a pair of alternate angles or a pair of corresponding angles are equal to each other. Proof: Method 1 In the triangle ABC, Since the side BA of the triangle ABC has been produced to E, This is a pair of alternate angles. Since a pair of alternate angles are equal, AD is parallel to BC. Method 2 and EAD According to the above figure, are a pair of corresponding angles. By showing that these two angles are equal in the same manner as above, we can show that BC // AD. Method 3 The above proof could also be given as follows using algebraic symbols.

The gravitational force on earth is six times the gravitational force on the moon. Therefore, the ratio of the weight of an object on the moon to the weight of the object on earth is 1 : 6.

If it is necessary to make a cement mixture using the whole bag, how many pans of sand are required? (iv) Find separately the number of pans of cement and the number of pans of sand  We know that, when we consider two quantities, if when one quantity increases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity also increases in the same ratio, or when one quantity decreases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity also decreases in the same ratio, then the two quantities are said to be directly proportional to each other. In an inverse proportion, when one quantity increases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity decreases in the same ratio, or when one quantity decreases according to a certain ratio, the other quantity increases in the same ratio. In a certain hostel, there is sufficient food stored for 12 hostellers for 4 days. Keeping this amount of food in mind, let us consider the following questions.  (i) If the number of hostellers is 15, will the food be sufficient for four days?  (ii) If the number of hostellers is 6, for how many days will the food be sufficient?  (iii) When the number of hostellers decreases, does the number of days for which It is clear that the food which is sufficient for 12 people for 4 days will be sufficient for 6 people for 8 days, and for one person for 48 days. The following relationships between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient can easily be identified. 12 8 6 4  2 1    
   
 
 
4 6 8 12 24 Let us see how the two quantities, namely the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient change proportionally. According to the above chart, when the number of hostellers decreases from 8 to 2, the number of days for which the food is sufficient increases from 6 to 24.                            In this case, the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1 The number of days for which the food is sufficient in this case has increased from 6 to 24.  The ratio of the number of days = 6 : 24 = 1 : 4 Although the ratio 1 : 4 is not equal to the ratio 4 : 1, the ratio that is obtained by interchanging the two numbers of one ratio is the same as the other ratio. Then,  the ratio of the number of hostellers = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1 the ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 24 : 6 = 4 : 1 A relationship such as the above one between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient is called an inverse proportion. Let us consider two more instances of the relationship between the number of hostellers and the number of days for which the food is sufficient. 12  1 Number of days  4  48    Ratio of the number of hostellers = 12 : 1  Ratio of the corresponding number of days interchanged = 48 : 4 = 12 : 1 The inverse proportion relationship should hold for any two cases that are considered, in the same manner that was observed in the above cases. It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. Find the number of days required by 10 men to complete the same task. Let us look at two methods that can be used to solve this problem. Note that this is a problem on inverse proportions.             Method 1 Let us take the number of days required by 10 men to complete the task as x. Then,  Number of men  5 10    Number of days  8  x    5 : 10 = x : 8  =      
 Time taken for 5 men to complete the task = 8 days Time taken for one man to complete the task = 8 days « 5 Note: In the above example, the number of days taken by one man to complete the task, which is 40, can be taken as a measurement of the magnitude of the task. This value is called the number of man days.  Magnitude of the task = Amount of time required by one man to complete the task  = Number of men « Number of days Accordingly, the magnitude of the above task can be considered as 40 man days. The magnitude of a task can be measured in terms of man days as well as in terms of man hours.    It takes 5 men 8 days to complete a certain task. How many men are required to complete the same task in 2 days? Let us use method (ii) of example 1.  The number of days required by 5 men to complete the task = 8  The number of days required by one man to complete the task = 8 « 5  The magnitude of the task = 8 « 5 man days  = 40 man days

If 8 more men join the workforce after 6 days, for how many more days will the food that is remaining be sufficient? Let us now consider how this problem is solved by two different methods. The food which is sufficient for the group of 40 men for 12 days will be sufficient for the 40 of them for 6 days and for a few more days for the 48 men, which includes the 8 who joined later. Let us take the number of days for which the food will be sufficient for the 48 men after the 6th day as x. We can then equate the amount of food sufficient for the 40 men for 12 days to the sum of the amount of food sufficient for the 40 men for 6 days and the 48 men for x days.  40 « 12  480  48x = (40 « 6) + (48 « x) = 240 + 48x = 480 − 240 = 240                                                (ii) The radius of a circle and its area (…….)

However, two days after the camp commenced, 6 of the trainees had to leave the camp due to illness. Show that the remaining food is sufficient for 2 extra days than was initially planned. 6. A particular tank of water can be emptied in four hours using three equal pumps. The three pumps were used to empty the tank. However one pump stopped working after an hour. Thereafter, the tank was emptied using the other two pumps. Find how much more time was required to empty the tank due to breakdown of one pump. If it takes eight men one day to complete a certain task, then • four men would require two days to complete the same task • if only two men are engaged, four days would be required to complete the task • it would take one man eight days to complete the task Observe that in all four of the above situations, the product of the number of men and the number of days is a constant. That is, This constant value is the magnitude of the task. The unit used to measure the magnitude of the task can be taken as man days. Accordingly, if x is the number of men and y is the number of days, then  xy = k (k is a constant)  x = k According to the definition of direct proportion, this can be expressed as ' That is, x and are directly proportional to each other. In this case we say that x and y are inversely proportional to each other. 8 men can complete a certain task in 9 days. However, it was possible to employ only 6 men. How many days will it take these 6 men to complete the task? Let us denote the number of men by x and the number of days by y. Then, by using the equation xy = k and substituting the data, we obtain the equations, 7. It takes half an hour for a certain vehicle travelling at a speed of 40 kmh-1 to complete a certain journey. Find the time in minutes that it would take the vehicle to complete the same journey, if it travels at a speed of 50 kmh-1.  (Hint: Man hours = no.of men « no.of days « no.of working hours per day)  (i) What is the magnitude of the task in man hours?  (ii) The four men decide to complete the task on the next day. How many hours       8 « 9 k and  6y Note that we can use the same constant k as we refer to the same task. Since it is the same task, the constant k is the same. Substituting for k, we obtain the equation A group of men, who completed a certain task in 9 days, recruited 3 more men to work on a similar task. If together they completed the task in 6 days, find how many men there were in the initial group. Suppose the number of men who were in the first group is x. Then, according to the data, we obtain the equations, 2. It was necessary to engage 9 men for 4 days, at 5 hours per day to clear a certain land. How many men working 6 hours per day can complete the same task in 10 days?    The information gathered from the grade 10 students of a certain school regarding the sport they like the most, of the three sports, namely cricket, volleyball and elle is given below. Cricket Volleyball Elle 25 20 15 The above information can be represented in a picture graph and a column graph as follows. The height of each column in the column graph denotes the number of students who like the relevant sport. In the picture graph this is denoted by the figures. The pie chart is another method of representing data. Pie charts are also called pie graphs. ² draw pie charts based on the given data ² extract information from a pie chart         Let us represent the 60 students by the total area of the circle, which corresponds to the angle of 360o around the centre of the circle. 1  That is, the angle at the centre of a sector which is In a pie chart, the area of the whole circle represents the total number of data. The different frequencies are represented by suitable sectors. As an example, let us consider the above circle which has been divided into 8 equal sectors. Since the circle has been divided into 8 equal sectors, the area of each sector is equal to Also, the angle around the centre of this circle is divided into eight equal parts by the sectors. 1 Therefore, the angle at the centre of each sector is  of the angle around the centre. The angle around the center is 360x. Therefore the angle at the centre of each sector is 1 of 360x.  Accordingly, the angle at the centre of the sector which denotes the 25 students who like cricket the most The sector which denotes the students who like cricket the most Similarly, the angle at the centre of the sector which denotes the 20 students who like volleyball the most The remaining sector of the circle represents the students who like elle. The ' However this is not corresponding angle at the centre can be found using necessary, since this angle is equal to the angle obtained by subtracting the above two angles from 360o' All the above facts can be shown in a pie chart as follows. Usually the angle at the centre is not denoted in a pie chart. Instead, the value represented by each sector is given as a percentage. Cricket 150x    It is not neccessary to calculate the angle at the centre of the sector denoting those who prefer vegetables since the remaining portion of the circle denotes this. The pie chart prepared according to the above information is given below. The comparison of data is facilitated by the sectors being shaded in different colours or covered with different patterns' Since all the data is represented by one circle comparisons such as ‘more than’ or ‘less than’ can easily be made.

The government of each country collects money from its citizens to meet recurrent expenses. This money is called taxes. Different types of taxes are collected in different ways and in varying amounts. The method that is used most to collect taxes is charging a percentage of the amount involved. Taxes that an individual has to pay directly to the government are called direct taxes. Several types of direct taxes are given below. • Rates • Customs duty • Income tax    Taxes that are not charged directly are called indirect taxes. Value added tax (VAT) is one such tax that is charged at present. Rates are taxes charged by urban councils, municipal councils, provincial councils etc., from households and businesses that come within their administrative domain. These taxes are used for various purposes such as the maintenance of roads and street lights, garbage collection and disposal etc. Properties owned by individuals and businesses are assessed annually by the government, and the relevant council charges a percentage of the assessed annual value of the property as rates. This is calculated annually and can be paid in total at the beginning of the year, or in 4 equal quarterly installments once every three months. A house of assessed annual value Rs. 36 000 is charged annual rates of 4%. Calculate the rates that have to be paid for a quarter.                 The assessed annual value of a shop within the administrative domain of a certain urban council is Rs. 24 000. The quarterly rates payable on this property is Rs. 300. Calculate the rates percentage charged by the council.  Assessed annual value of the shop = Rs. 24 000  Rates charged for a quarter = Rs. 300  Rates charged for the year = Rs. 300 = Rs. 1 200  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When certain items are imported or exported, a certain percentage of the value of the item has to be paid as taxes to the government. Such taxes are called customs duty. This tax is charged by Sri Lanka Customs. Individuals who have worked abroad are entitled to a duty free quota on their return, which may be used to purchase certain items without paying customs duty, from the duty free shops housed in the international airport. Further, certain government servants are entitled to a reduction in customs duty when importing vehicles. If customs duty of 10% of the value of the item has to be paid when a certain type of clock is imported, how much duty has to be paid when a clock of this type of value Rs. 5 000 is imported?                          When a car is imported, 60% of its value has to be paid as customs duty. Find the total amount with the duty included, that it costs a person to import a car worth Rs. 2 000 000.

                                                          The government imposes a tax on the annual income of an individual, which is earned as salary, from property or through a business, and which exceeds a certain limit. Such taxes are called income taxes. The income tax for a particular year can either be paid annually or in quarterly installments. A table with the information on how the taxes are calculated, which was implemented in 2011 by the Inland Revenue Department is given below. (These values may change in the future) Initial Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Next Rs. 500 000 Balance taxable income Tax Percentage Tax free 4% 8% 12% 16% 20% 24% This table is used to perform calculations related to the examples and problems on income tax in this lesson. If the annual income of an individual is Rs. 575 000, calculate the income tax he has to pay for the year.  The annual income = Rs. 575 000  Tax free income = Rs. 500 000  Taxable income = Rs. 575 000 − 500 000                 If the annual income of a certain businessman is Rs. 1 650 000, calculate the total annual income tax he has to pay.

The annual income of a certain individual is Rs. 550 000. How much income tax does he have to pay according to the income tax rates implemented in year 2011 (table 13.1)? 13. If a businessman paid an annual income tax of Rs. 56 000 in 2012 according to the income tax rates implemented in 2011 (table 13.1), what is his annual income? When a loan has been taken from an individual or an institution, the extra amount that has to be paid when settling the loan after a period of time is called the interest. Similarly, when money has been deposited in a bank or some other financial institution for a period of time, the extra amount that is received at the end of the period is also called the interest. Usually, the interest that has to be paid for a year is a percentage of the loan amount (or deposit amount). This percentage is called the annual interest rate. The interest rate can also be given monthly or semi-annually. When calculating the interest for a specific period, if only the initial amount (principal) is taken into consideration, then such interest is called simple interest. It took a man 2 years to settle a loan of Rs. 5 000 borrowed at an annual simple interest rate of 10%. How much interest did he pay in total?  Simple interest paid for two years = Rs. 500 = Rs. 1 000      as follows. Import price of vehicle  Customs duty  Port charges and transportation cost    = Rs. 600 000 = Rs. 400 000 = Rs. 50 000 If VAT of 15% was charged on all these expenses, how much did he have to pay in total for the vehicle? 16. VAT of 15% is added to the monthly water bill of a household. If Prathapa pays a total of Rs. 1 725 as his monthly water bill, find the value of the bill without the VAT.                Find the total amount that Senal has to pay to settle a loan in three months, if he borrowed Rs. 8 000 at a monthly simple interest rate of 2%. = Rs. 8 000 = Rs. 160 = Rs. 160 = Rs. 480 Since total amount = Loan + Interest, = Rs. 8 000 + 480 = Rs. 8 480    How long will it take for a person who gave a loan of Rs 10 000 at an annual simple interest rate of 12%, to receive an interest of Rs. 3 600? Number of years it takes to receive Rs. 3 600 as interest If the simple interest that had to be paid for two years, on a loan of Rs.7 500 was Rs.1 200, find the annual simple interest rate that was charged.  Interest for two years  Interest for a year = Rs.1 200 = Rs.1 200 2 = Rs.600 = 600 7500  Example 5 How many years after taking a loan of Rs. 25 000 at an annual simple interest rate of 7.5%, does a person have to pay a total amount of Rs. 28 750 to settle the loan? = Rs. 1 875 Loan = Rs. 25 000  Total amount to be paid = Rs. 28 750         7.5 100                                                                  Example 6 If the total amount that had to be paid after 4 months to settle a loan borrowed at a monthly simple interest rate of 1.5% was Rs.5 300, find the loan amount. The meaning of “A monthly simple interest rate of 1.5%” is that “Rs.1.50 has to be paid as interest for a month for a loan amount of Rs 100.  That is, interest paid for 1 month on a loan of Rs.100 = Rs'1.50  Interest paid for 4 months on a loan of Rs. 100 = Rs'1.50 « 4 = Rs'6  Total amount paid in 4 months for a loan of Rs. 100 = Rs'100 + 6 = Rs'106  Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs'106 = Rs'100  has to be paid after 4 months  Loan amount for which the total amount of Rs. 5300 =  has to be paid after 4 months  
 
 
2. A man deposits Rs.50 000 in a bank at a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. If he withdraws the interest he receives monthly, how much interest does he get in total during a period of 6 months? 5. If a person who gave a loan of Rs. 6 000 at an annual simple interest rate, received Rs.3 600 as interest for four years, what is the annual simple interest rate that was charged?                        8. At what annual simple interest rate should a loan of Rs.5 000 be given to receive the same interest that is received when a loan of Rs.6 000 is given at an annual simple interest rate of 8%? 13. A person takes a loan of Rs.5 000, promising to pay interest at a monthly simple interest rate of 5%. How much does he have to pay in total to settle the loan in 6 months? 16. A person takes a loan on annual simple interest, promising to settle the loan in two years by paying Rs.5 000. However he was only able to settle the loan in 5 years, at which time he had to pay Rs.6 500.  (i) Calculate the interest he has paid for a year.  (ii) What was the amount he borrowed?  (iii) What was the annual simple interest rate that was charged?  (i) Write down an expression for the interest he has to pay for a month.  (ii) Write down an expression for the total interest I that he has to pay for a   Let us work on the following exercise in order to revise the knowledge we have acquired on solving simple equations. Did you observe that some of the equations in the above exercise contain fractions. The unknown term (x, y, p, a) was in the numerator of the fraction?. Now we are going to construct and solve equations with fractions of which the unknown term is in the denominator. Let us construct and solve such an equation. Twelve is divided by two numbers of which the value of one number is double that of the other. The difference between the two quotients is 2. Find the two numbers. ² construct and solve simple equations with algebraic fractions ² construct and solve simultaneous equations ² solve quadratic equations using factors     Thus, the problem can be solved using the method of trial and error. However, for some problems, the trial and error method is too long. Also, some problems cannot be solved by trial and error method. A suitable method of solving this type of problems is by using equations. Now, let us see how it can be solved by constructing an equation. Suppose 12 is divided by a number x and its double 2x. Then the quotient of 12 divided by x is The value of x obtained by solving this equation gives us the required number. Let us solve this equation. This is an equation having fractions with algebraic terms in the denominator. The first fraction contains x in the denominator. The second fraction has 2x in the denominator. Let us make the denominators of both fractions  by the equivalent fraction equal. The easiest way to do this is by replacing      Note:This equation can be solved by writing the equation cross multiplication too. Several friends shared 60 mangoes equally. One of them, Amal, sold three of his mangoes, and then he had only two mangoes left. How many friends shared the mangoes? In reality, this problem can easily be solved mentally. Nevertheless, let us solve this equation as follows just to illustrate the construction and solving of equations. Let x be the number of friends. Then, the number of mangoes one person obtains = Let us now solve this equation. Let us add 3 to both sides.  Then, 5x = 60  Hence, x = 12.                   1. A father and his sons equally shared an amount of Rs 270. Then the amount each person had was Rs 45. Taking the number of sons as x, construct an equation. Solve this equation and hence find the number of sons the father has. 2. When the same number was added both to the numerator and the denominator of , the resulting fraction was equal to 9 ' What number was added?        The coefficient of the unknown x in each of the equations is 2. That means, they are equal. We have seen how to solve simultaneous equations of this nature, i.e., when the coefficients of one unknown are equal. Let us see how simultaneous equations are solved when the coefficients of both unknowns are un equal, i.e., the coefficients of each unknown are different. Sajithi and Sanjana have certain amounts of money. When twice the amount of money Sanjana has is added to the amount of money Sajithi has, we get Rs. 110. When thrice the amount of money Sanjana has is added to twice the amount of money Sajithi has, the amount is Rs. 190. Find the amount of money each has. Let us see how simultaneous equations can be used to solve this problem. Let the amount of money Sajithi has be Rs. x and the amount of money Sanjana has be Rs. y. Then, the sum of the amount of money Sajithi has and twice the amount of money Sanjana has is Rs. x + 2y. Because this amount is equal to Rs. 110, we get Also, the sum of twice the amount of money Sajithi has and thrice the amount of money Sanjana has is Rs. 2x + 3y. Because this amount is equal to Rs 190, we get The coefficients of neither x nor of y of the equations (1) and (2) are equal. Therefore, let us equate the coefficients of one of the unknowns. In order to make the coefficient of x in the first equation 2, let us multiply that equation by 2. Then we get Now, the coefficients of x in both equations are equal. Therefore, from 3 and 2 , we get,  2x + 4y – (2x + 3y) = 220 – 190  2x + 4y – 2x – 3y = 30  y = 30 Substituting the value of y in the first equation,                         Therefore, the amount of money Sajithi has is Rs 50 and the amount of money Sanjana has is Rs 30. The price of two oranges and one king coconut is Rs. 80. Three king coconuts cost the same amount as two oranges. Find the price of an orange and a king coconut separately.  From 1 × 3, we get, 6m + 9n = 39  From 2 × 2, we get, 6m + 10n = 42 Then, from 4 and 3 , we get, et us denote the two equations as 1 2 2m + 3n = 13 3m + 5n = 21 Solve: 2m + 3n = 13 3m + 5n = 21  6m + 10n – (6m + 9n) = 42 – 39  6m + 10n – 6m – 9n = 3  n = 3 Substituting n = 3 in (1), we get 2m + 3n = 13 2m + 3×3 = 13  2m = 13 – 9  2m = 4 m = 2 i.e., m = 2 and n = 3           Then, the price of two oranges and a king coconut is 2x + y. Since this is equal to Rs. 80, we get  2x + y = 80  2x = 3y 1 2 These two equations can be solved just the way we did in the previous example, by writing the second equation as 2x – 3y = 0. However, there is an easier way to do it in this case. That is, substituting from one equation to the other. 3y + y = 80  4y = 80  y = 20 Substitute y = 20 in (1) to get  2x + 20 = 80  2x = 60  x = 30       Solve: x = 3y  2x + 3y = 18 Denote the two equations as  x = 3y 2x + 3y = 18 Substitute for x in equation (2) from equation (1) to get 2 « (3y) + 3y = 18  6y + 3y = 18  9y = 18  y = 2 Substitute y = 2 in (1) to get          
x = 3y x = 3 « 2 x = 6 i.e., x = 6 and y = 2.              An equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation where a ≠ 0. The terms b and c might be 0. Observe the following equations.  ^i& x2 + 5x + 6 = 0  ^ii& 2x2 – 5x = 0 ^iii& x2 – 9 = 0 Each of the above equations is a quadratic equation since a ≠ 0, whereas c = 0 in the second equation and b = 0 in the third equation. Before solving the quadratic equations, let us consider the following:  • When any number is multiplied by zero, the product is zero. • If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers is zero. So, let us see for what values of x the expression (x – 1)(x – 3) is zero. The expression is zero only when x – 1= 0 or x – 3 = 0, that is, only when x =1 or x = 3. ^a& x + 2y = 10 2x – 5y = 2  ^e& 2x + 5y = 9 3x + 2y = 8  ^f& 4m – 3n = 7 7m – 2n = 22  ^j& 3x – 4y = 8 ^2 – y& + 1 2 ^2x + 3y & = 26 – y   ^c& 2m + n = 5  m + 2n = 4   ^d& 3x + y = 14 2x + 3y = 21  ^h& 6x + 5y = 5 9x – 4y = 19  2. The price of two baby shirts and three pairs of baby shorts is Rs. 1150. Three baby shirts and a pairs of baby shorts cost Rs. 850. Taking the price of a baby shirt as Rs. x and that of a pairs of baby shorts as Rs. y, construct two simultaneous equations and find the price of a baby shirt and that of a pairs of baby shorts separately by solving the two equations. 3. Dinithi’s father tells Dinithi, “My age is now four times your age. 8 years earlier, I was twelve times older than you.” Find the present ages of the father and Dinithi separately.         Now, consider the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0. Since x2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2), the equation can be rewritten as (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0. Then, x + 3 = 0 or x + 2 = 0. There fore, x = –3 and x = –2 satisfy the equation. This can be verified as follows. When x = –3,  = 9 + ^–15& + 6  = 0 When x = –2,  x2 + 5x +6 = ^–2&2 + 5^–2& + 6  = 4 +^–10& + 6  = 0 Thus, the roots of the equation x2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are –3 and –2. In other words, the solutions of the equation are x = –3 and x = –2.  x2 + 2x = 0  x ^x + 2& = 0  x = 0 or x + 2 = 0  x = 0 or x = – 2 Hence, x = 0 and x = –2 are the solutions of the given equation.  Example 2 Solve the equation x2 – 3x + 2 = 0  x2 – 3x + 2 = 0  ^x – 1& ^x – 2& = 0  x – 1 = 0 or x – 2 = 0 x = 1 or x = 2                Example 3 Solve the equation x2 – 4x – 21 = 0  ^x – 7& ^x + 3& = 0 x – 7 = 0 or x + 3 = 0  x = 7 or x = – 3 Hence, x = 7 and x = – 3 are the solutions of the given equation. Note: When there are two factors to a quadratic expression, there are two distinct roots to the that equation.  ^a& ^x – 2& ^ x – 3& = 0 ^c& ^x – 4& ^ x – 4& = 0 ^e& x ^ x + 3& = 0 ^g& x2 – 16 = 0 ^i& 9x2 – 27x = 0 ^k& 2x2 – 5x + 2 = 0 ^m& 2x2 = 6x ^o& ^x + 3&2 = 16 ^q& ^2x – 3&2 = 0 ^s& ^x – 1& ^ x – 2& = 2x2 – 3x – 2                            ^b& ^ x + 2& ^ x – 5& = 0 ^d& ^x – 1& ^ 2x – 1& = 0 ^f& y ^2y – 3& = 0 ^h& 4x2 – 1 = 0 ^j& x2 + 15x + 36 = 0 ^l& 2x2 – 5x = 0 ^n& x2 = 25 ^p& x2 = 9x + 36 ^r& 2x2 – 5x = 0 ^t&   A closed plane figure bounded by four straight line segments is called a quadrilateral.

By studying this lesson, you will be able to • identify methods of describing sets • identify the regions in a Venn diagram when at most two sets are represented in the Venn diagram and solve problems using the formula     • the descriptive method • the method of listing elements • the Venn diagram method. Let A be the set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10. Then, A can be denoted using the above three methods as follows: • As a description,  A = {multiples of 3 between 1 and 10} or  A = set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10. • Listing the elements A = {3, 6, 9} • In a Venn diagram, Set builder method is another method to describe sets. The set of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 10 can be denoted using the set builder method as follows: The symbol x here is like a variable. You may use any symbol in place of x. The statement after the colon describes how the elements should be. There are several ways a set can be represented using the set builder method. For example, the following are three different ways of denoting the set A = {1, 2} using the set builder method.      3 6 9                A = { x : (x – 1) (x – 2) = 0 } A = { y : A = {n 1. Describe the set of all positive integers from10 to 15 using  (i) the descriptive method  (ii) the listing method  (iii) a Venn diagram  (iv) the set builder method. 2. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.  (i) A = {3, 6, 9, 12} 3. Describe each of the following sets using the descriptive method.  i. X = {All letters in the word “ANURADHAPURA”}  ii. A = {x : x is a prime number and 10 < x < 20}  A = {Positive integers less than 10} A = {x: x  or  C 3                       In Venn diagrams, the universal set is represented by a rectangular region and is denoted by ε.  ε  The subsets of the universal set are represented by circular (or elliptical) regions. These subsets give rise to several regions in the Venn diagram that represents the universal set. Now let us investigate these regions. The subset A divides the universal set into two regions which are shaded in the next figure.The subsets corresponding to these regions can be denoted by A and A using set notation. 4. Describe each of the following sets using a Venn diagram.  (i) A = {7, 14, 21, 28}  (ii) B = {Vowels in the English alphabet}  : x2 = 4}  (iii) Y = {x 5' Describe each of the following sets using the set builder method'  (i) X = {Odd numbers between 1 and 10}  (ii) Y = {0" 1" 2" 3}                                         Let A and B be the two subsets. When there are no common elements in A and B, that is, when A∩B = O , and when there are common elements in A and B, that is when A∩B O, the relevant Venn diagrams are shown below.   A B Before investigating the regions let us recall the following definitions.  A = Set of elements not in A  = Set of elements belonging to both A and B  = Set of elements belonging to A or B (or both) As an example, let us take ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}  A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and  B = {2, 3, 5, 7}  = {2} and  = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}  (  ( 180  ) = {1, 9} and ) = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}                                        Two subsets of a universal set represented in a Venn diagram give rise to several regions' Some such regions and the way they can be written down using set complement, set intersection and set union are shown below.        (i) A ∩B  (iii) (A∩B)  (v) (A∩B) (vii) (A ∩B) (viii) (A  (ix) (A B)    
 (ii) A B  (iv) (A B)  (A B) (vi) (A∩B )  B )  (i) A∩B (iii) A ∩B  (v) (A B)  (ii) A B (iv) A  B (vi) (A ∩B) 3. The information on the children in a society is shown in the following Venn diagram. (The letters a, b, c and d indicate the regions in which the letters are written.) Age above 10 years Describe in words the regions indicated by each of the letters a, b, c and d. For example, the boys whose ages are above 10 years are indicated by a. 4. Let ε = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}  A ∩B = {4, 5}  A∩B = {3}  (A B) = {1}  Include the above information in a suitable Venn diagram and hence find A, A B and B ∩A.           Shown below is a Venn diagram with two subsets A and B of the universal set such that A∩B O. Here n1, n2 and n3 denote the number of elements in the respective regions. (Though it is expected to write the elements inside the regions, we have written down the number of elements for ease.) Let us the denote the number of elements belonging to the subset A by n(A) etc. Then, from the figure, we see that  n (A) = n1 + n2  n (B) = n2 + n3  n (A∩B) = n2  n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n3 Now, we write, n (A∪B) = n1 + n2 + n2 + n3 – n2     The Venn diagram when the two subsets A and B are disjoint (i.e.,when A∩B = O ) is shown below. In this case, we see that n (A) = n1 n (B) = n2  n (A∪B) = n1 + n2                 Information on the numbers of students who participate in football and cricket are shown in the following diagram (In this case too, the numbers in the regions indicate the numbers of students in the regions). How many students are 1. participating in football? n (F) = 8 +7 = 15 2. participating in cricket? n (C) = 7 + 15 = 22 3. participating in both sports (both football and cricket)? n (F ∩ C) = 7 4. participating in cricket only? n (C ∩ F ) = 15 5. participating in football only? n (F ∩ C ) = 8 6. participating in football or cricket (or both)? n (F ∪ C) = 8 + 7 + 15 = 30 7. not participating in football? n (F ) = 15 + 5 = 20 8. not participating in cricket? n (C ) = 8 + 5 = 13 9. participating in exactly in one of the two sports? n {(F ∩ C ) ∪ (F ∩ C )}        The information obtained through a survey from a set of farmers in a certain village about the kind of crop they grow in their farms is shown in the following Venn diagram. Football  (F) Cricket  (C)                1. vegetables? n (Y) = 25 2. paddy? n (X) = 7 + 25 = 32 3. only paddy? n (Y ∩X) = 7 4. only vegetables? n(X ∩Y) = 0 5. both vegetables and paddy? n (X∩Y) = 25 6. vegetables or paddy? n (X∪Y) = 7 + 25 = 32 7. neither of the two crops? n (X∪Y) = 13     Exercise 18.3 1. Find n(A∪B) if n (A) = 35, n (B) = 24, n(A∩B) = 11.  Find n(P), n(Q), n(P ∩ Q), n(P ∪ Q) and verify the formula  n(P ∪ Q) = n(P) + n(Q) – n(P ∩ Q) 6.
