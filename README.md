EduGenius is an innovative AI-powered tutoring platform developed by us who are three undergraduates at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, as our Semester 5 project.

The platform addresses challenges in modern education by offering personalized and efficient tutoring for O/Level students in mathematics. Leveraging advanced technologies such as LangChain and pre-processed mathematics marking schemes stored in a vector database, EduGenius generates tailored tutoring materials and provides instant, real-time feedback and grading. This approach enhances the learning experience, empowering students with a more interactive and supportive learning environment.
